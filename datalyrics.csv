Smooth,"(feat. Rob Thomas)
Man it's a hot one 
Like seven inches from the midday sun 
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone 
But you stay so cool 
My munequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa 
Your my reason for reason 
The step in my groove 
And if you say this life ain't good enough 
I would give my world to lift you up 
I could change my life to better suit your mood 
Cause you're so smooth 
And just like the ocean under the moon 
Well that's the same emotion that I get from you 
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth 
Gimme your heart, make it real 
Or else forget about it 
I'll tell you one thing 
If you would leave it would be a crying shame 
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out 
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio 
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow 
Turning you round and round",Santana 
How You Remind Me,"Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
for handing you a heart worth breaking
and I've been wrong, i've been down,
to the bottom of every bottle
these five words in my head
scream ""are we having fun yet""
yet, yet, yet, no, no
yet, yet, yet, no, no
it's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
And this is how, you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how, you remind me
Of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken

Gloria,"Gloria, you're always on the run now
Running after somebody, you gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown, so be careful not to show it
You really don't remember, was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?
Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you, why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line, oh-oh-oh, calling Gloria
Gloria (Gloria), I think they got your number (Gloria)
I think they got the alias (Gloria) that you've been living under (Gloria)
But you really don't remember, was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?
A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, Gloria, how's it gonna go down?
Will you meet him on the main line, or will you catch him on the rebound?
Will you marry for the money, take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away, don't believe it's comin' back soon
And you really don't remember, was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

Firework,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under?
Scream but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe you reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""

Look Away,"When you called me up this morning, 
told me 'bout the new love you found, 
I'm said "";I'm happy for you, 
I'm really happy for you.""; 
Found someone else, 
I guess I won't be coming 'round. 
I guess it's over, baby; 
it's really over, baby, whoa... 
And from what you said 
I know you've gotten over me; 
it'll never be the way it used to be. 
So if it's gotta be this way, 
don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay. 
But if you see me walking by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way. 
When we both agreed as lovers, 
we were better off as friends, 
that's how it had to be, 
yeah, that's how it had to be. 
I tell you I'm fine 
but sometimes I just pretend; 
wish you were holding me, 
wish you were still holding me, whoa... 
I just never thought, 
that I would be replaced so soon; 
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you. 
I know I wanted to be free; 
yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be. 
But if you see me waling by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way.

Philadelphia Freedom,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 
I used to be a rolling stone 
You know if the cause was right 
I'd leave to find the answer on the road 
I used to be a heart beating for someone 
But the times have changed 
The less I say the more my work gets done 
`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom 
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag 
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man 
Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had 
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you 
Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind 
Shine a light shine a light 
Shine a light won't you shine a light 
Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do 
If you choose to you can live your life alone 
Some people choose the city 
Some others choose the good old family home 
I like living easy without family ties 
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me 
Right between the eyes",Elton John 
Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Gotye:]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[Kimbra:]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
[Gotye:]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough
And you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Waterfalls,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam
She'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping
At all 'cause he can't seem to keep
His self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and lakes that
You're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way
Or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is baby it's good to me
One day he goes and takes a glimpse
In the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
3 letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
[Chorus]
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin' prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

I Will Survive,"At first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side;
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Did I crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no, not.I. I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive;
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give and I'll survive,
I will survive. Hey hey.
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
And so you feel like droppin' in
And just expect me to be free,
Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups, 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that  quot;hard quot; role 
And tell you that the butt ain't go
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waste is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Turn your back on mother nature

Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind youSo glad we've almost made it
So sad they had TO fade it

Bleeding Love,"Closed off from love 
I didn't need the pain 
Once or twice was enough 
And it was all in vain 
Time starts to pass 
Before you know it you're frozen 
But something happened 
For the very first time with you 
My heart melts into the ground 
Found something true 
And everyone's looking round 
Thinking I'm going crazy 
But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 
Trying hard not to hear 
But they talk so loud 
Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
Try to fill me with doubt 
Yet I know that the goal 
Is to keep me from falling 
But nothing's greater 
Than the rush that comes with your embrace 
And in this world of loneliness 
I see your face 
Yet everyone around me 
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe 
But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding

You cut me open 
And it's draining all of me 
Oh they find it hard to believe 
I'll be wearing these scars 
For everyone to see 
I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding

I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love

Killing Me Softly With His Song,"Strumming my pain with his fingers

I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him 
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters 
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Lose Yourself,"Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity

Would you capture it or just let it slip 
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Is he No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook:]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on

I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama's screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another jam or not 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got

Hurts So Good,"When I was a young boy,
Said put away those young boy ways
Now that I'm gettin' older, so much older

Before He Cheats,"Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blond tramp, 
and she's probably getting frisky... 
right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey... 
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick, showing her how to shoot a combo... 
And he don't know... 
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive, 
carved my name into his leather seat... 
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights, 
slashed a hole in all 4 tires... 
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats. 
Right now, she's probably up singing some 
white-trash version of Shania karoke.. 
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk"" 
and he's a thinking that he's gonna lucky, 
Right now, he's probably dabbing 3 dollars worth of that bathroom Polo... 
And he don't know... 
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive, 
carved my name into his leather seat, 
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights, 
slashed a hole in all 4 tires... 
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats. 
I might saved a little trouble for the next girl, 
Cause the next time that he cheats... 
Oh, you know it won't be on me! 
Ohh... not on me...

Sweet Child O' Mine,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that
special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me
of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go

How Am I Supposed To Live Without You,"I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin'

From the look upon your face, I see it's true
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the
plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I suppose to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I suppose to live without you
How am I suppose to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone
I didn't come here for cryin'
Didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you
When I build my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much
more than friends
And I don't wanna know the price I'm
gonna pay for dreaming
When even now it's more than I can take

Barely Breathing,"Barely Breathing 
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear 
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears 
You really had me going, wishing on a star 
But the black holes that surround you are heavies by far 
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn 
Well it must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born 
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide 
You really can't be serious if you have to ask me why 
I say goodbye... 
'Cause I am barely breathing, And I can't find the air 
I don't know who I'm kidding, imaging you care 
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day 
But I don't suppose it's worth the price, worth the price 
The price that I would play 
Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? 
I used to be so certain, and I can't figure out 
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain 
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame 
Will it ever change? 
Chorus
I've come to find, I may never know 
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe? 
I rise above, or sink below 
With every time, you come and go 
Please don't come and go

I Just Called To Say I Love You,"No new years's day
to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring
no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of June
But what it is
Is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is
Though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words Could ever do.I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

Down Under,"Traveling in a fried-out combie
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said,
 Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover. 
Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said,  Do you speak-a my language 
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
And he said,
 I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover. 
Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man,  Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty 
And he said,
 Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover.",Men At Work 
Without You,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrorow
When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
Can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Run-Around,"Music & Lyrics: John Popper
Once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down 
And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme so don't you feed me a line 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down 
Tra la la la la bombardier this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
My cup shall always be full 
Oh I like coffee
And I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay
So be that way
I hope and pray
That there's something left to say 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down",Blues Traveler 
The Power Of Love,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake
[first chorus]
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
[second chorus]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn

Shiny and new

The Most Beautiful Girl,"Governments elected nobody votes
Politically correct isn't that a joke

Four letter disease still makes us run

Can I start things over
And change your mind
Can I sing a melody

Can I move your feet make your heart skip a beat
Can a simple tune flow through you

When you lose control you gotta go with it
Ten feet high
Flyin' above the sky
Your problems don't exist

Starvin' to death
In Bosnia we close our eyes and hide a nation cries
And In the West

We think real life is reality TV

Can a piece of me Flow through you

Seasons In The Sun,"Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABC's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye, my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the sping is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons have all gone
Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the familiy
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them I'll be there
We had joy, we had fun...
Goodbye, Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye, Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there
All our lives we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach",Terry Jacks

How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do.
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow.
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow, noone said a word about the sorrow.
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.",Bee Gees

You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on
Cause you had a bad day

You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie

And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong
So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Had a bad day

Everything You Want,"Somewhere there's speaking

You howl and listen

Echoes of angels who won't return

To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for 
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

It Must Have Been Love,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely,
there's air of silence in the bedroom
and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.
It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been love but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out.
Make-believing we're together that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winters day, I dream away.
It must have been love but it's over now.
It's all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,

Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside
After a while we run under a tree
I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes

Would pass me by

A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you

If you ever 
Think of me

And I don't belong

Precious memories
'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder....
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight
And I, I
Don't want to let you know
I, I
Drown in your memory
I, I
Don't want to let this go
I, I
Don't....
Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces passed
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making my way
Through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder....
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you...
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
If I could 
Just hold you
Tonight",Vanessa Carlton 
Right Here Waiting,"I hear your voice on the line

Blue Velvet,"She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears
She wore blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears",Bobby Vinton

Wild Night,"As you brush your shoes and stand before your mirror
And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat
And you walk the streets trying to remember
All those wild nights breeze through your mind
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
oooh, oo-ooh wee the wild night is calling
All the girls walked by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the Boogie Woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with the wild wonder
And the inside Jukebox roars just like thunder
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
oooh, oo-ooh wee the wild night is calling
The wild --------- night is calling
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance
And everything looks so complete

And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying

We Built This City,"Chorus: 
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Say you don't know me or recognize my face 
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place 
Knee deep in the hoopla sinking in your fight 
Too many runaways eating up the night 
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember 
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Chorus: 
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Someone always playing corporation games 
Who cares they're always changing corporation names 
We just want to dance here someone stole the stage 
They call us irresponsible write us off the page 
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember 
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
It's just another Sunday, in a tired old street 
Police have got the choke hold, oh then we just lost the beat 
Who counts the money underneath the bar 
Who rides the wrecking ball in two rock guitars 
Don't tell us you need us, 'cos we're the ship of fools 
Looking for America, coming through your schools 
(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge 
Out on another gorgeous sunny Saturday, not seein' that bumper to bumper traffic) 
Don't you remember ('member)('member) 
(What's your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city 
The city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps) 
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember

We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll 
Built this city, we built this city on rock and roll

Ode To Billie Joe,"See the funny little people running 'round in circles
throwing bombs as they do
See the funny side of it
they're heading straight for you
See the funny little holes they're making
looking like craters on the moon
See the funny side of it
we'll be living in them soon
But it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
but it's getting pretty near the end
cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend
so there's never anything to spend
you're broke, you dope you
See the funny little flying saucers we found
painted up just for you
see the funny man inside
his color matches too
See the silly little camera he loves
shooting pictures with all day
see the funny side of it
his friends are on their way
But it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
but it's getting pretty near the end
cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend
so there's never anything to spend

Candle In The Wind 1997,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 
Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
You called out to our country 
And you whispered to those in pain 
Now you belong to heaven 
And the stars spell out your name 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will 
Loveliness we've lost 
These empty days without your smile 
This torch we'll always carry 
For our nation's golden child 
And even though we try 
The truth brings us to tears 
All our words cannot express 
The joy you brought us through the years 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned our long before 
Your legend ever will 
Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
Goodbye England's rose 
From a country lost without your soul 
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion 
More than you'll ever know 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And you footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will",Elton John 
Greatest Love Of All,"I believe the children are our are future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 
[Chorus:]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
[Chorus]
And if by chance, that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",Whitney Houston

It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only cut

You Light Up My Life,"So many nights I sit by my window 
Waiting for someone to sing me his song 
So many dreams I kept deep inside me 
Alone in the dark but now 
You've come along 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water 
Could it be finally I'm turning for home? 
Finally, a chance to say hey, 
I love You 
Never again to be all alone 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
It can't be wrong 
When it feels so right 
'Cause You 
You light up my life",Debby Boone

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)

Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible professional
Drinking X&O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think? Whoa
Did her thing seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close

Hey shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans filled with guap and they're ready for showing
Cadillacs laid back for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I'm dealing rubber bands
That's when I threw her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That heny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky on me I was just like clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her
[Chorus (T-Pain)]
[Flo-Rida]
Whoa shawty yeah she was worth the money
Little mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was zoned in sexy woman
Let me show it make me want it
Two in the morning I'm zoned in
Them rosee bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop
Made it drop
Shawty dipped that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fine just like my glock

I Knew I Loved You,"Maybe it's intuition

a little crazy but I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life 
There's just no rhyme or reason
only this sense of completion
and in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I found my way home

a little crazy but I believe

I Miss You,"I thought I heard your voice yesterday.
When I turn around to say
That I loved you then I realized.
And It was just my mind playing tricks on me.
It seems colder lately at night.
And I try to sleep with the lights on.
Every time the phone rings.
I pray to god it's you.
I just can't believe that we're through.
CHORUS:
I miss you (I miss you).
There's no other way to say it.
And I, and I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you).
It's so easy to see.
I miss you and me.
Is It done and over this time?
Have we really changed our minds?
But It's others love, all the feelings.
Tha we used to share.
I refuse to believe.
That you don't care.

I've got together my senses (to) get there.
I've been through worse kinds of weather.
If It's over now, be strong.

My Eyes Adored You,"My eyes adored ya 
Though I never laid a hand on you 
My eyes adored ya 
Like a million miles away from me you Couldn't see how I adored ya 
So close, so close and yet so far 
Carried your books from school 
Playin' ""make-believe you're married to me"" 
You were fifth-grade I was sixth 
When we came to be 
Walkin' home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you 
Went our separate ways 
My eyes adored ya 
Though I never laid a hand on you 
My eyes adored ya 
Like a million miles away from me you Couldn't see how I adored ya 
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights 
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame 
I worked my fingers to the bone 
Made myself a name 
Funny I seemed to find 
That no matter how the years unwind 
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss 
And the love I left behind 
My eyes adored ya 
Though I never laid a hand on you 
My eyes adored ya 
Like a million miles away from me you Couldn't see how I adored ya 
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember

How warm and tender we were way back then whoa whoa baby

Got my maple syrup, everything but you.

Called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
Picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
Saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.
Go about my business, I'm doin fine
Besides, what would I say if U had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday.
Brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up. Turn the sheets down.
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hot into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Nobody's Supposed To Be Here,"I've spent all my life, on a search to find 
The love who'll stay for eternity 
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs 
But when I turn around 
Again, love has knocked me down 
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad 
I'm sad to say, love wins again 
So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 
[Chorus:]
How did you get here 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
I've tried that love thing for the last time 
My heart says no, no! 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
But you came along and changed my mind 
This time I swear I'm through 
But if only you knew 
How many times I've said those words 
Then fall again, when will I ever learn 
Knowing these tears I cry 
This lovely black butterfly 
Must take a chance, and spread my wings 
Love can make you do some crazy things 
So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 
No, nobody, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh! 
No, no, no...

Semi-Charmed Life,"I'm packed and I'm holding 
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden 
She lives for me, says she lives for me 
Ovation, her own motivation 
She comes round and she goes down on me 
And I make her smile, like a drug for you 
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you 
Keep on smiling, what we go through 
One stop to the rhythm that divides you 
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse 
Chop another line like a coda with a curse 
Come on like a freak show takes the stage 
We give them the games we play, she said... 
I want something else, to get me through this 
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby 
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye 
The sky was gold, it was rose 
I was taking sips of it through my nose 
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there 
Smiling in the pictures you would take 
Doing crystal myth, will lift you up until you break 
It won't stop, I won't come down 
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop 
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given 
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again 
I said... 
How do I get back there, to the place where I fell asleep inside you 
How do I get myself back to the place where you said... 
I want something else, to get me through this 
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby 
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye 
I believe in the sand beneath my toes 
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling 
I believe in the faith that grows 
And the four right chords can make me cry 
When I'm with you I feel like I could die 
And that would be all right, all right 
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing 
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive 
Now I'm struggling to survive, those days you were wearing that velvet dress 
You're the priestess, I must confess 
Those little red panties they pass the test 
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress 
One 
And you hold me, and we're broken 
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now 
Feel myself, head made of the ground 
I'm scared, I'm not coming down 
No, no 
And I won't run for my life 
She's got her jaws now, locked down in a smile 
But nothing is all right, all right 
And I want something else, to get me through this life 
Baby, I want something else 
Not listening when you say... 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye 
Good-bye 
The sky was gold, it was rose 
I was taking sips of it through my nose 
And I wish I could get back there 
Someplace back there, in the place we used to start 
I want something else",Third Eye Blind

It's an ancient Chinese art, and everybody knew their part

They can dance, we'll stay home instead

Wake me up before you go-go

No Scrubs,"A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster (busta, busta...)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So (no)
I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time and (no)

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
There's a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
Cuz I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass
So (no) (yea, yea)
I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time (no)

If you don't have a car and you're walking 
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (baby)
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (yea yea yea yea...)
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no I don't want no (oh)

See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs never risin'
I don't find it surprisin'
If you don't have the g's
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you somethin' to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screen
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular
And then I get back to ya
With diamond like precision
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition
From your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho
Not really, T-Boz and all my senoritas
Is steppin' on your Filas
But you don't hear me though

The Game Of Love,"(feat. Michelle Branch)
Tell me just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me why don't you come around no more
Cause right now I'm crying outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
This, whatever you make it to be
Sunshine set on this cold lonely sea
So please baby try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't sayin' goodbye that's knocking down the door of your candy store
[Chorus]
It's all in this game of love
You roll me
Control me
Console me
Please hold me
You guide me
Divide me
Into what...

So please tell me why don't you come around no more
Cause right now I'm dying outside the door of your loving store

Luck'll come and then slip away, you've gotta move, bring it back to stay

I swear by stars above, sweet as honey
People think you're down and out, you show them what it's all about
You can make it, roll with it, baby
When this world turns its back on you, hang in and do that sweet thing you do
You just roll with it, baby, you just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby, you and me, just roll with it, baby
Now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby, you'll hear the music play, you'll dance, baby
You'll leave bad times way behind, nothing but good times on your mind
You can do it, roll with it, baby
Then you'll see life will be so nice, it's just a step up to paradise
You just roll with it, baby, you just roll with it, baby
You and me, just roll with it, baby, Come on and just roll with it, baby",Steve Winwood 
Waiting On The World To Change,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting

Hero,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
[Chorus:]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
[Chorus]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
[Chorus]",Mariah Carey 
How's It Going To Be,"I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore 
Before you take a swing 
I wonder what are we fighting for 
When I say out loud 
I want to get out of this 
I wonder is there anything 
I'm going to miss 
I wonder how it's going to be 
When you don't know me 
How's it going to be 
When you're sure I'm not there 
How's it going to be 
When there's no one there to talk to 
Between you and me 
Cause I don't care 
How's it going to be, How's it going to be 
Where we used to laugh 
There's a shouting match 
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch 
A silence I can't ignore 
Like the hammock by the 
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty 
Don't see lightning like last fall 
When it was always about to hit me 
I wonder how's it going to be 
When it goes down 
How's it going to be 
When you're not around 
How's it going to be 
When you found out there was nothing 
Between you and me 
Cause I don't care 
How's it going to be 
And how's it going to be 
When you don't know me anymore 
And how's it going to be 
Want to get myself back in again 
The soft dive of oblivion 
I want to taste the salt of your skin 
The soft dive of oblivion oblivion 
How's it going to be 
When you don't know me anymore 
How's it going to be, How's it going to be 
How's it going to be",Third Eye Blind

Hello,"I've been alone with you 
Inside my mind 
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips 
A thousand times 
I sometimes see you 
Passing outside my door 
Hello!
Is it me you're looking for? 
I can see it in your eyes 
I can see it in your smile 
You're all I've ever wanted 
And my arms are open wide 
Because you know just what to say 
And you know just what to do 
And I want to tell you so much 
I love you 
I long to see the sunlight in your hair 
And tell you time and time again 
How much I care 
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow 
Hello!
I've just got to let you know 
Because I wonder where you are 
And I wonder what you do 
Are you somewhere feeling lonely? 
Or is someone loving you? 
Tell me how to win your heart 
For I haven't got a clue 
But let start by saying I love you

Just The Way You Are,"[Verse 1:]

Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday (yeahh)
I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay? ""
I say

I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

Crocodile Rock,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
when Suzie wore her dresses tight
and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last",Elton John

Pull one down for you,
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth:
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems.
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams.
And I can change the world,
I will be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
And if I could be king,
Even for a day,
I'd take you as my queen;
I'd have it no other way.
And our love would rule
This kingdom we had made.
Till then I'd be a fool,
Wishing for the day...
That I can change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,

So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up

It feels so good in my hood tonight

   (This is how we do it) 
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air 
And wave them from here to there 
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be player 
You see the hood's been good to me 
Ever since I was a lower-case G 
But now I'm a big G. The girls see I got the money 
A hundred-dollar bills y'all 
If you were from where I'm from then you would know 
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck

But if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.

I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean
on.
Please swallow your pride, if have things you need to borrow.
For no one can fill those needs that you won't let show.

Opposites Attract,"I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it 
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it 
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool 
With my homegirl, Paula Abdul 
Baby seems we never ever agree 
You like the movies 
And I like T.V. 
I take things serious 
And you take 'em light 
I go to bed early 
And I party all night 
Our friends are sayin' 
We ain't gonna last 
Cuz I move slowly 
And baby I'm fast 
I like it quiet 
And I love to shout 
But when we get together 
It just all works out 
[Chorus:] 
I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
Who'd a thought we could be lovers 
She makes the bed 
And he steals the covers 
She likes it neat 
And he makes a mess 
I take it easy 
Baby I get obsessed 
She's got the money 
And he's always broke 
I don't like cigarettes 
And I like to smoke 
Things in common 
Just ain't a one 
But when we get together 
We have nothin' but fun 
I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract

Baby ain't it somethin' 
How we lasted this long 
You and me 
Provin' everyone wrong 
Don't think we'll ever 
Get our differences patched 
Don't really matter 
Cuz we're perfectly matched 
[Repeat Chorus Twice]
[Sung in the ""ShutUp & Dance"" version and in the ""Opposites Attract"" Music Video]
Nothing in common but this trust 
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus 
One going up, one coming down

When things go wrong we make corrections 
To keep things moving in the right direction 
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack

Lights,"I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me

You shine It when I'm alone

Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine It when I'm alone

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me that gentle loving stare

The way I feel about you,
It just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you

U Got It Bad,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past - you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

Then baby...
U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend

You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad
When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars
(You can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy

Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can
See I've been there, done it, fucked around

That you got it bad...hey

Lollipop, lollipop
Breasts is just like Dolly Part-on

""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?""
Don't worry why my wrist got so freeze
Tell her, ""Girl, like Doritos, that's (na-cho cheese)""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin to (Lay)
I cain't (only have one) and I ain't tryin to wait""
This a song with Wayne, say you know it's gon' melt
Butchu ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hunnid degrees, drop the roof, so the Coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need ohh-ohh-OH-OHHH!!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two seats, and you out of booooounds

Shawty want a thug, thug, thug...
Bottles in the club, club club...
Shawty wanna hump, you know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps...
[Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the rapper..
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I (Anita Bake) her, now she caught up in that (Rapture)
I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mutha-fudge cakes, now tell me how dat fudge taste
I do it for Bloods' sake, suu-woo think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so-so-sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all (she) do is (bang)!
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye - pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-can't-make-an-appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it - remix!
[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]
[Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feeling of, me bein the shit
'cause I was leavin skid marks on, ev'rywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere, innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in yo', neighborhood area, CD thang, tape deck
IPod, ya gurlfriend and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex

And with it let me say
Let me say
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
That maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out heaven save me
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
That maybe six feet

Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how you get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me

Holding my pillow tight
I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how you get things back

Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you

Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong

Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,"I walk a lonely road 
The only one that I have ever known 
Don't know where it goes 
But it's home to me and I walk alone

On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams 
Where the city sleeps 
and I'm the only one and I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk a...

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah 
I'm walking down the line 
That divides me somewhere in my mind 
On the border line 
Of the edge and where I walk alone 
Read between the lines 
What's fucked up and everything's alright 
Check my vital signs 
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk alone 
I walk a...

Follow You Down,"(Scott Johnson, Bill Leen, Phillip Rhodes, Jesse Valenzuela, Robin Wilson)
Did you see the sky
I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand
So what the hell now, we've already been forever damned
Anywhere you go I'll follow you down...",Gin Blossoms 
I Will Follow Him,"I will follow Him,
Follow Him wherever He may go,

There isn't an ocean too deep,
A mountain so high it can keep, 
Keep me away, away from His love.
I love Him, I love Him, I love Him, 
And where He goes,
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow.
I will follow Him,
Follow Him wherever He may go,

A mountain so high it can keep,
Keep me away, away from His love...

We Are The World,"There comes a time, when we hear a certain call 
When the world must come together as one 
There are people dying, and it's time to lend a hand. 
To life the greatest gift of all 
We can't go on, pretending day by day 
That someone somewhere will soon make a change 
We are all part of God's great big family 
And the truth, you know that love is all we need 
Chorus:
We are the world, we are the children 
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving 
There's a choice we're making 
We're saving our own lives 
It's true, we'll make a better day just you and me. 
Send them your heart, so they'll know that someone cares 
And their lives will be stronger and free 
As God has shown us, by turning stones to bread. 
So that we all must lend a helping hand. 
Chorus:
We are the world...... 
Break:
When you're down and out 
There seems no hope at all 
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall 
Well, well, well, well, let's realise 
That a change can only come 
When we stand together as one

yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-
haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
Cut up, Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes
Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different
reasons for that
Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
and I want to be someone to believe

Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be
somebody for me.""

funky as you can be

when I look at the television, I want to see me staring
right back at me

about as happy as I can be

 And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
 In the leaves on the trees and the touch
of the breeze
 There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me.
 There is only one wish on my mind
 When this day is through I hope
that I will find
 That tomorrow will be just the same
for you and me
 All I need will be mine if you are here.

And the wicked wind whispers 
And moans 
You got your demons 
You got desires 
Well, I got a few of my own 
Oo, someone to be kind to in 
Between the dark and the light 
Oo, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you 
One of these nights 
One of these dreams 
One of these lost and lonely dreams 
We're gonna find one 
One that really screams 
I've been searching for the daughter 
Of the devil himself 
I've been searching for an angel in white 
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little 
Of both 
And I can feel her but she's nowhere 
In sight 
Oo, loneliness will blind you 
In between the wrong and the right 
Oo, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you 
One of these nights 
One of these nights 
In between the dark and the light 
Coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you 
Get 'ya baby one of these nights

One of these nights 
I can feel it 
I can feel it

Coming right behind you

E.T.,"You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

Down to be open for some satisfaction

I should make a move but I won't

The world will never ever be the same

That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night

Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before

Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

Don't Turn Around,"If you wanna leave

See if I care
Go on and go, but
Don't turn around

Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away

I'm letting you go
But I won't let you go
I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight
And if you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine

I'll make it through

All coiled up and hissin

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(what)
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win
[1] - I like the way you work it
No diggity, I try to bag it up, bag it up
[Repeat 1 (3x)]
She's got class and style
She's managed by the town,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching catichin' vilians is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs 
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rolin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

The book of love will open up
And let us in

Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still, instead

Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign

By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son
They're gone
The sun shines bright
And anger rises
Lorn and lonely
Torn apart

It's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss

That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise
So let's pray
And blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying
Crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name

Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
That's what minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense
Outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore",Daryl Hall & John Oates

Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent

Stay away, don't you invade my home.

Don't come in - I'll only run and hide.

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
Don't ever let them win",Crowded House 
Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"(Nickolas Ashford/Valerie Simpson) 
If you need me, call me. No matter where you are, no matter how far. Just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry. On that you can depend and never worry.
(You see, my love is alive It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow. So if you feel the need for company, please, my darling, let it be me. I may not be able to express the depth of the love I feel for you, but a writer put it very nicely when he was away from the one he loved. He said down and wrote these words:)
No wind, (No wind) no rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal
No wind, no rain,
Can stop me, babe
If you wanna go
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch you so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (One more time)
Ain't no river wild enough (Say it again)
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you",Diana Ross 
Crazy For You,"Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that
Chorus:
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see
(chorus)
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you",Madonna 
As I Lay Me Down,"It felt like spring time on this February morning 
In the courtyard birds were singing your praise 
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel 
Alright I carried them with me today now 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 
I wonder why 
I feel so high though I am not above the sorrow 
Heavy hearted 'till you call my name 
And it sounds like church bells or the whistle of a train 
On a summer evening I'll run to meet you barefoot 
Barely breathing 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy (oh darling) 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 
It's not too near for me 
Like a flower I need the rain 
Though it's not clear to me 
Every season has its change 
And I will see you 
When the sun comes out again 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy (oh oh...) 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 
I wonder why 
(hmmm) 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again (oooh) 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again (hmmm) 
(comes out comes out oooh) 
And I will wake up happy 
So I pray",Sophie B. Hawkins 
Higher Love,"Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is a wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring be a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
Bring it...Oh bring it...
I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?",Steve Winwood

Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh baby don't you hesitate cause
Tonights the night 
It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
C'mon angel my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside Tonights the night
It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild

Upstairs before the night's too old

Lean Back,"(feat. Fat Joe (a.k.a Joey Crack) & Remy)
Yeah... My niggas...
Throw ya hands in the air right now man...
Feel this shit right here... 
[Verse 1 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack]
I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishappenin's,
Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,
Kids clappin' love to spark the place,
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face,
It's a cold world, and this is ice,
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.
Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave.
10 years been legit they still figure me bad.
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit.
Should've been called armed robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny...
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit.
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.
[Chorus]
Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
See we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
[Verse 2 - Remy]
R to the E'zzy',
M to the whizz-i [Y],
My arms stay breezy, 
The Don's stay fizz-i,
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 740'fizz-i
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,
With a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies.
Listen we don't pay admission,
And bouncers don't check us,
And we walk around the metal detectors.
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor,
Reckless, check it, said it?!
Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed 
now we 'bout to change the game nigga.
[Chorus]
Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
[Verse 3 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack]
Now we livin' better now, 
Gucci sweater now,
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now,
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's.
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit,
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.
'Cause half these rappers get ""Blow"" like Dereck Foreal.
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up.
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker,
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this,
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.
[Chorus]
my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.",Terror Squad

Jump Around,"Pack it up, pack it in

I came to win
Battle me that's a sin

Try and play the role and the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up, come on!
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling jump across the ceiling
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk
Yo, I'll bust em in the eye
And then I'll take the punks home
Feel it, funk it
Amps it are junking
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunking
Donuts shop
Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down [2x]
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around [3x]
Jump up Jump up and get down
Jump [18x]
I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle bring a shotgun
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Try and step to me you'll take your last breath
I gots the skill, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot ta give, I shoot to kill

Listen to the sound that pounds, I jump around
I'm no clown, I get down
To the funk, listen to the wig out
And step to the rear, dear, cause I'm here
The P to the E to the T E rockin'
The runs in your stockin'
So hon, put the lock in
Chillin' with the House Of Pain
Blood stains the ground
Huh, I jump around
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator

Try'n to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics homie I'll wet ya

A Horse With No Name,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There was sand and hills and rings 
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz 
And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la ... 
After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la ... 
After nine days I let the horse run free 
'Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
there was sand and hills and rings 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And a perfect disguise above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

Viva La Vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",Coldplay 
Til I Hear It From You,"(Jesse Valenzuela, Robin Wilson, Marshall Crenshaw)
I didn't ask
They shouldn't have told me
At first I'd laugh, but now
It's sinking in fast
Whatever they've sold me
Well baby I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you
It gets hard
The memory's faded
Who gets what they say
It's likely they're just jealous and jaded
Well maybe I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you
I can't let it get me off
Or break up my train of thought
As far as I know, nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you
Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in
Til we're talking about it, not stepping around it
Maybe I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool",Gin Blossoms

Higher,"When dreaming I'm guided to another world 
Time and time again 
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep 
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape 
From the life I live when I'm awake 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay 
Can you take me Higher
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher 
To a place with golden streets
Although I would like our world to change 
It helps me to appreciate 
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights 
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same 
The only difference is 
To let love replace all our hate 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape 
Come on, let's go there 
Let's ask can we stay 
Can you take me Higher
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher 
To a place with golden streets
So lets go there, lets go there,
Come on, lets go there
Lets ask can we stay
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine 
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine 
Can you take me Higher
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher 
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me Higher

Alone Again (Naturally),"In a little while from now

And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: "";My God, that's tough
She's stood him up"";
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to well wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Or if He really does exist
Why did He desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that there are more hearts
broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?
Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",Gilbert O'Sullivan

Mmm but when that change comes
Will you still feel the same?
How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't want to give up
But baby it's time I had two feet on the ground
Can you release me
Can you release me
Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?
Release me
Can you release me
Chorus:
Come on baby, come on baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we want to be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby you've just got to release me
Release me
Release me
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find
What you're looking for
(Chorus)
What is this power you've got on me
What is this power, Oh
What is it,What is it
(Chorus)
Release me
Will you release me
Ah...Release me
Will you release me",Wilson Phillips

Breathe,"I can feel the magic floating in the air

To settle on the breeze 
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms 
The whole world just fades away 
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart 
Cause I can feel you breathe 
It's washing over me 
And suddenly I'm melting into you 
There's nothing left to prove 
Baby all we need is just to be 
Caught up in the touch 
A slow and steady rush 
And baby isn't that the way 
That love's supposed to be 
I can feel you breathe 
Just breathe 
In a way I know my heart is waking up 
As all the walls come crumbling down 
Closer than I've ever felt before 
And I know and you know 
There's no need for words right now 
Cause I can feel you breathe 
It's washing over me 
And suddenly I'm melting into you 
There's nothing left to prove 
Baby all we need is just to be 
Caught up in the touch 
A slow and steady rush 
And baby isn't that the way

It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone
Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be

Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine 
Left us so little to give 
That same old crowd 
Was like a cold dark cloud 
That we could never rise above 
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love 
Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love, oh 
Sweet darlin', you get the best of my love 
I'm goin' back in time 
And it's a sweet dream 
It was a quiet night 
And I would be all right 
If i could go on sleepin' 
But every mornin' 
I wake up and worry 
What's gonna happen today 
You see it your way 
And I see it mine 
But we both see it slippin' away 
You know we always had each other baby 
I guess that wasn't enough 
Oh, but here in my heart 
I give you the best of my love 
Oh, sweet darlin' 
You get the best of my love 
Oh, sweet darlin' 
You get the best of my love 
Every night and day, 
You get the best of my love 
Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love 
Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love..

Under The Bridge,"Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all that way

Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you
Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love evryday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no

Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on

Feel the strength of passion in your soul

Just keep the fire burning at home

As he catches the poor old ladies' eyes
Just for fun he says "";Get a job"";

They say hey little boy you can't go
Where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do
Said hey old man how can you stand
To think that way
Did you really think about it
Before you made the rules
He said, Son
That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
But don't you believe them
Well they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
Because the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar
That's just the way it is
Some things will never change

I still can't turn away 
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose 
Got tossed along the way 
And letters that you never meant to send 
Got lost or thrown away
And now we're grown up orphans 
And never knew their names 
We don't belong to no one 
That's a shame
But you could hide beside me 
Maybe for a while 
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name
And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far 
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
Did you get to be a star
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are
We grew up way too fast 
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history 
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name 
I won't tell em' your name

Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?

Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.

Do You Really Want To Hurt Me,"Give me time
To realise my crime
Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Precious kisses
Words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why
In my heart the fire's burning
Choose my colour
Find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step
A step too far 
Chorus:
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Words are few
I have spoken
I could waste a thousand years
Wrapped in sorrow Words are token
Come inside and catch my tears
You've been talking but believe me
If its true You do not know

I'm prepared to let you go 
If it's love you want from me
Then take it away

Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?,"To really love a woman 
To understand her - you gotta know her deep inside 
Hear every thought - see every dream 
N' give her wings - when she wants to fly 
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms 
Ya know ya really love a woman 
When you love a woman you tell her 
that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her 
that it's gonna last forever 
So tell me have you ever really 
- really really ever loved a woman? 
To really love a woman 
Let her hold you - 
til ya know how she needs to be touched 
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her 
Til you can feel her in your blood 
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes 
Ya know ya really love a woman 
When you love a woman 
you tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her 
that you'll always be together 
So tell me have you ever really - 
really really ever loved a woman? 
You got to give her some faith - hold her tight 
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right 
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you 
Ya really gotta love your woman...",Bryan Adams

Kyrie,"Kyrie eleison, kyrie eleison, kyrie 
The wind blows hard against this mountain side, across the sea into my soul 
It reaches into where I cannot hide, setting my feet upon the road 
My heart is old, it holds my memories, my body burns a gemlike flame 
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine, is where I find myself again 
Chorus: 
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel 
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night 
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going will you follow 
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light 
When I was young I thought of growing old, of what my life would mean to me 
Would I have followed down my chosen road, or only wished what I could be

You have to be fulfilling all my dreams 
If you really want me baby

   	And I gave you all my trust 
   	Would you comfort me? 
   	And if somehow you knew 
   	That your love would be untrue 
   	Would you lie to me? 
   	And call me baby 
You said you want my love 
And you've got to have it all 
But first there are some things you need to know 
If you wanna live with all I have to give 
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah 
I don't want you tryin' to get with me 
And I end up unhappy

I have to know the truth 
If I spend my life with you

It's Still Rock And Roll To Me,"-- Billy Joel
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
""Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?""
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
""Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of while wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that they're out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight `A' student?
""If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.""

Every Rose Has Its Thorn,"We both lie silently still 
in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together

Though I tried

Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and 
easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now 
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains
Solo
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

and that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees
I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste
She always had a pretty face
So I wondered how she hung around this place

There's got to be something better than 
In the middle
But me & Cinderella
We put it all together We can drive it home
With one headlight

It feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sign up ahead
At the county line bridge
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothin' left
She hit the end it's just her window ledge
Hey, come on try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than 
In the middle
But me & Cinderella
We put it all together We can drive it home
With one headlight
Well this place is old
It feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
I think of death it must be killin' me

Teardrops On My Guitar,"Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll be she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
[Chorus:]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause
[Repeat Chorus]
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into..
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.",Taylor Swift 
One More Try,"I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say you love me
But if you don't
Just let me go....
'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the dannger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go....
And teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh so I don't want to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try",George Michael

like the wind was blowing it apart
as you're spinning like a merry-go-round,
indications of a storm touching down
wish that i could weather any storm,
but i guess it was heart break from the norm
was a day i will always remember,
the saddest day in sweet november...
Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout u baby

bring my baby back, right back to me
if lovin you was right then i don't wanna go wrong
so i drown myself with tears,

Tell all the boys
Or keep it low
If I say no
Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you stay

Be eternity

Is off the change 
Is perfect now
But will it change
This aint a yes
This aint a no
Just do your thang

My Heart Has A Mind Of Its Own,"I told this heart of mine our love could never be
But then I hear your voice and somethin' stirs inside of me
Somehow I can't resist the memory of your kiss
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
No matter how I try I just can't turn the other way
When I'm with someone new I always think of you
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
You're not in love with me so why can't I forget
I'm just your ""used-to-be"", it's wrong, and yet
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I just can't seem to break the string
I say ""I'll let you go"" but then my heart says ""no""
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
Guess my heart has a mind of its own",Connie Francis

Maniac,"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night 
Looking for the fight of her life 
In the real time world no one sees her at all 
They all say she's crazy 
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart 
Changing movement into light 
She has danced into the danger zone 
When the dancer becomes the dance 
It can cut you like a knife 
If the gift becomes the fire 
On the wire between will and what will be 
She's a maniac maniac on the floor 
And she's dancing like she's never danced before 
She's a maniac maniac on the floor 
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
On the ice blue line of insanity 
Is a place most never see 
It's a hard won place of mystery 
Touch it but can't hold it 
You work all your life 
For that moment in time 
It can come or pass you by 
It's a push shove world 
But there's always a chance 
If the hunger stays the night 
There's a cold kinetic heat 
Struggling stretching for the peak 
Never stopping with her head against the wind 
She's a maniac maniac at your love 
And she's a maniac maniac at your love 
And she's dancing like she's never danced before's 
Dancing like she's never danced before",Michael Sembello

Like a demon sick and sick and tired of being alone,
I've made a bed that is hard to lie in,
But if lovin' you is wrong,
I can't do nothing but sin

Take Good Care Of My Baby,"I can't seem to remember if you were kinder
Did you even care about my piece of mind
I find that in the end, you're just a big old..
I can't seem to recall why you keep on laughing
At your stupid jokes, they're a waste of your time
Cause I find that in the end, you're just a big old bore
And I never wanted more than just a little fun
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
And I don't wanna live up to your standards
I can't seem to believe how your little obsession
Has you by the throat and has you running blind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to believe how you keep on clutching
With all your might to your nickels and dimes
I find that in the end you're just a big old bore
And I never wanted more than just a little fun
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
And I don't wanna live up to your standards
I'd always thought that we had the same goals
But now I know what you're after
You'll do anything to get what you want
And there's nothing that I wouldn't put past you
It's pathetic to see how uptight you can be
When things don't all go your way
I can't seem to remember when you first began to start this shit
And tried to mess with my mind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to recall why years have gone by and you're still the same
You stay trailing behind and I find that in the end
You know you're a big old bore
Who wished that she'd had  more than just a little fun
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
And I don't wanna live up to your standards",Bobby Vee

Sir Duke,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over peopleYou can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over-all over now people
Can't you feel it all over
Come on let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody-all over people

From A Distance,"From a distance the world looks blue and green,
and the snow-capped mountains white.
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,
and the eagle takes to flight.
From a distance, there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
it's the voice of every man.
From a distance we all have enough,
and no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
no hungry mouths to feed.
From a distance we are instruments
marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.
God is watching us. God is watching us.
God is watching us from a distance.
From a distance you look like my friend,
even though we are at war.
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
what all this fighting is for.
From a distance there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
it's the heart of every man.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves.
This is the song of every man.
And God is watching us, God is watching us,
God is watching us from a distance.
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching.

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid

You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

You held my hand when it was cold 
When I was lost you took me home 
You gave me hope when I was at the end

The Sounds Of Silence,"The Sound of Silence
Hello darkness, my old friend, 
I've come to talk with you again, 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping, 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence. 
In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence. 
And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more. 
People talking without speaking, 
People hearing without listening, 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare 
Disturb the sound of silence. 
 Fools  said I,  You do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows. 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
Take my arms that I might reach you.  
But my words like silent raindrops fell, 
And echoed 
In the wells of silence 
And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made. 
And the sign flashed out its warning, 
In the words that it was forming. 
And the sign said,  The words of the prophets 
are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls.  
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Simon and Garfunkel 
Kryptonite,"I took a walk around the world

I watched the world float 
To the dark side of the moon

Something to do with you

You called me strong, you called me weak,
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times 
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, 
If not for me then you would be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again
A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away

I come from a place that hurts

And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again
Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again
Hold me
Hold me

Say you love me

One that made you have to say goodbye

To touch your lips, to hold you near 
When you say your prayers try to understand 
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man 
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near 
When he says the words you've been needing to hear 
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine

Yeah, I will love you baby - Always

I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),"And I would do anything for love, I'd run right into hell and back
      I would do anything for love, I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
        But I'll never forget the way you feel right now, oh no, no way
      And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, I won't do that
        Anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
       I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, oh I won't do that
  Some days it don't come easy, and some days it don't come hard
    Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
    Some nights you're breathing fire, and some nights you're carved in ice
    Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again
    Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
    I know you can save me, no one else can save me now but you
      As long as the planets are turning, as long as the stars are burning
        As long as your dreams are coming true, you better believe it
      That I would do anything for love, and I'll be there til the final act
        I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
        But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight
        And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
    Oh I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that
            I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
            But I just won't do that
  Some days I pray for silence, and somedays I pray for soul
    Some days I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N Roll
    Some nights I lose the feeling, and some nights I lose control
 Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
    Maybe I'm lonely and that's all I'm qualified to be
    There's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
  As long as the wheels are turning, as long as the fires are burning
    As long as your prayers are coming true, you better believe it
 That I would do anything for love, and you know it's true and that's a fact
    I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
    But I'll never do it better than I do it with you, so long, so long
    And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no no no I won't do that
    I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
    But I just won't do that
   But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life, no way
     And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
     I would do anything for love
     But I won't do that
     No I won't do that
    Will you raise me up, will you help me down?
    Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
    Will you make it all a little less cold?
    I can do that! I can do that!
    Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
    Can you colorize my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
    Can you make it all a little less old?
    I can do that! Oh oh, now I can do that!
    Will you make me some magic, with your own two hands?
    Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
    Can you give me something I can take home?
    I can do that! Oh oh now, I can do that!
    Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
    Will ya hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
    Will you take me places I've never known?
    I can do that! Oh oh now, I can do that!    
    After a while you'll forget everything
    It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
    And you'll see that it's time to move on
    I won't do that! No I won't do that!
     I know the territory, I've been around
    It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
    And sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
    I won't do that! No I won't do that!

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care
[Chorus]
Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care

Always there when you call, always on time

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine

We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon,
We stayed in separate rooms

Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before
Since you've been gone,
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

U Remind Me,"Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen.
See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try,
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you.
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.
Thought that she was the one for me,
Til I found out she was on her dream,
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.
This is why we could never be.
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.
I know it's so unfair to you,
But I'd be lingering the rest to you,
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance, dont you know
If they move too quick (oh whey oh)
They're falling down like a domino.
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got their money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh whey oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette.
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say:
Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian.
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh whey oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more.
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh whey oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian.
All the kids in the market place say:
Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian.
Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard, you know (oh whey oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac.
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh whey oh)
Spin the clubs, cruise down the block.
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh whey oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian.

Because Of You,"I will not make the same mistakes that you did

Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard

To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything

Men In Black,"Artist: Will Smith (formerly Fresh Prince)
Album:  Big Willie Style *
Song:   Men in Black
* originally appeared on the soundtrack Men in Black
Uh...
	Here come the Men in Black
It's the M.I.B.'s, uhh, here come the M.I.B.'s
	Here come the Men in Black
	They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me -- M.I.B.
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there
is now gone, black suit with the black Ray Ban's on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no figerprints
Saw somethin strange, watch your back 
Cause you never quite know where the M.I.B.'s is at
Uh and...
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	Galaxy defenders (oahhaooohh ohhhhh)
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	They won't let you remember
Uh uh, uh uh, now
from the deepest of the darkest of night
on the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no M.I.B.'s, can I please
do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean  I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
M.I.B.'s, freezin up all the flack
(What's that stand for) Men In Black
Uhh M
	The Men in Black...
	The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me
Just slide with me c'mon 
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me 
Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze...
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	The galaxy defenders
Right on, right on
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	They won't let you rememberk (ohhhh nooooo)
Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin
I know we might seem imposin
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
Cause we see things that you need not see 
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in...
	Here come the Men in Black (here they comeeeee)
	The galaxy defenders (ga-la-xy de-fenders)
	Here come the Men in Black (ohhhh here they come)

The River Of Dreams,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
>From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross
And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Though the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night",Billy Joel 
I Kissed A Girl,"This was never the way I planned, not my intention.
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.
I'm curious for you, caught my attention.
[Chorus:]
I kissed a girl and I liked it,
the taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl just to try it,
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
It felt so wrong,
it felt so right.
Don't mean I'm in love tonight.
I kissed a girl and I liked it (I liked it).
No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter.
You're my experimental game, just human nature.
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused, hard to obey.
[Chorus]
Us girls we are so magical,
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable.
Hard to resist, so touchable.
Too good to deny it.
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent.
[Chorus]",Katy Perry 
Halo,"Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down

They didn't even make a sound

Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking

Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out!

Master Blaster (Jammin'),"Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you 
would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun
Didn't know that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you

Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,

jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling

Lay Down Sally,"by Eric Clapton, Marcy Levy and George Terry
There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me.
I know you've got somewhere to go,
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave.
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon.
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.
The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above.
Underneath the velvet skies,
Love is all that matters. Won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave.
Chorus
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily.
So don't you go and say goodbye,
You can lay your worries down and stay with me.
And don't you ever leave.

Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,"I don't wanna lose you, 
I don't wanna use you 
Just to have sombody by my side 
And I don't wanna hate you 
I don't wanna take you 
But I don't wanna be the one to cry 
That don't really matter to anyone, anymore 
But like a fool I keep losing my place 
And I keep seeing you walk through that door 
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much 
And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust 
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are 
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough 
Now I could never change you 
I don't wanna blame you 
Baby you don't have to take the fall 
Yes I may have hurt you 
But I did not desert you 
Maybe I just want to have it all 
It makes a sound like thunder 
It makes me feel like rain 
And like a fool who will never see the truth 
I keep thinking something's gonna change 
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much 
And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust 
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are 
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough 
And there's no way home 
when it's late at night and you're all alone 
Are there things that you wanted to say 
Do you feel me beside you in your bed 
there beside you where I used to lay 
And there's a Danger in Loving somebody too much 
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch 
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are 
Cause baby sometimes love just ain't enough

You can have it your way, how do you want it 
You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it 
Temperature rising, okay lets go to the next level 
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a teakettle 
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple 
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho 
In the hotel or in the back of the rental 
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into 
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor 
Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha 
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem 
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider 
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit 
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can 
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands (ha ha) 
[Chorus]

Girl what we do (what we do) 
And where we do (and where we do) 
The things we do (things we do) 
Are just between me and you (oh yeah) 
[Verse 2: 50 Cent] 
Give it to me baby, nice and slow 
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo 
You ain't never heard a sound like this before 
Cause I ain't never put it down like this 
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper 
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker 
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs 
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone 
I touch the right spot at the right time 
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind 
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind 
As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I aint stoppin 
Drippin wet with sweat man its on and popping 
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on 
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

Set Fire To The Rain,"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew.
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.
[Chorus:]
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say,
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.
[Chorus:]
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you.
[Chorus:]
I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, ohhhh!

Tried to find the truth

Girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care.

If you say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life

That all  I really (all I really) want is you.
Sorry if you felt misled
But I know what I feel, I know what I said, baby
God I hope you believe, believe in all that we can be
The future in us together in love.

Don't you think I don't know
This is where I belong
Give me the time
To say that you're mine, to say that you're mine.

All Out Of Love,"I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know
(Chorus) 
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long, lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too? 
does the feeling seem oh, so right? 
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on? 
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day 
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone 
(Chorus) 
Ooh, what are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
what are you thinking of

Whatta Man,"Yeah, yeah (Oooo)
Uh, hey hey
All right, yeah
Oooo
[CHORUS]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby
[CHORUS]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find
[CHORUS]
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that
[CHORUS]",Salt 'N Pepa 
Beautiful,"[Spoken]
Don't look at me
Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the fame, I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone and the puzzle undone
That's the way it is
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words won't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words won't bring you down
Don't you bring me down today...
No matter what we do 
(no matter what we do)
No matter what they say 
(no matter what they say)
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go 
(everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine 
(sun will always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 
All the other times
We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down
We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words can't bring us down
Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today",Christina Aguilera 
Heaven,"Love is forever - as I lie awake 
Beside you 
I believed - there's no heaven 
No hideaway - for the lonely 
But I was wrong - crazy 
It's gotta be strong 
It's gotta be right 
Only wanted to stay a while 
Only wanted to play a while 
Then you taught me to fly like a bird 
Baby - thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Such a night I never had before 
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for 
Ooo it's so easy 
What you do to me all night angel 
I never loved - I swear to God 
Never needed no one, 'til you came along 
Here I come baby 
It's gotta be strong - it's gotta be right 
Only wanted to stay awhile 
Only wanted to play awhile 
Then you taught me to fly like a bird 
Baby - thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Such a night I never had before 
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for 
I feel fast asleep - I feel drunk 
I dream the sweetest dreams 
Never wanna wake up 
Never thought it could be this way 
No doubt about it - can't live without it 
Never thought it could be this good 
You made love to me - the way it oughta be",Bryan Adams 
Ironic,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought...it figures
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
""Well isn't this nice...""
And isn't it ironic...dontcha think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought...it figures
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face
A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic...dontcha think
A little too ironic...and yeah I really do think...
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take

Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out

When Can I See You,"When can my heart beat again
When does the pain ever end
When do the tears stop from running over
When does you'll get over it begin
I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you
When can I see you again
When can my heart beat again
When can I see you again
And when can I breathe once again
And when can I see you again
When does my someday begin
When I'll find someone again
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you

Torn,"I thought I saw a man brought to life 
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified 
He showed me what it was to cry 
Well you couldn't be that man I adored 
You don't seem to know, 
don't seem to care what your heart is for 
But I don't know him anymore 
There's nothing where he used to lie 
My conversation has run dry 
That's whats going on, nothing's fine I'm torn 
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed into something real 
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn 
You're a little late, I'm already torn 
So I guess the fortune teller's right 
Should have seen just what was there 
and not some holy light 
To crawl beneath my veins and now 
I don't care, I have no luck, I don't miss it all that much 
There's just so many things that I can't touch, I'm torn 
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed into something real 
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn 
You're a little late, I'm already torn. Torn. 
There's nothing where he used to lie 
My inspiration has run dry 
That's what's going on, nothings right, I'm torn 
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed into something real 
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

Crazy,"I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that phase. 
Even your emotions had an echo 
In so much space 
And when you're out there 
Without care, 
Yeah, I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Probably 
And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
But think twice, that's my only advice 
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are, 
Ha ha ha bless your soul 
You really think you're in control 
Well, I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb 
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them 
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun 
And it's no coincidence I've come 
And I can die when I'm done 
Maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy

I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
It's something comes over me
In a daze, it is so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off my feet
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak
I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
You're love is so sweet
Knocks me right off my feet
I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
It's something comes over me
In a daze, it is so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off my feet
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak
I get so weak
Blood starts racin through my veins I got so weak
Boy, it's something that I can't explain I get so weak
Something 'bout the way you do the things you're doin'
Knocks me right off my feet (off my feet)
I can't explain why your lovin makes me weak
I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
It's something comes over me
In a daze, it is so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off my feet
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak",SWV

Time After Time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, 
and think of you 
caught up in circles confusion-- 
is nothing new 
Flashback--warm nights-- 
almost left behind 
suitcases of memories, 
time after-- 
sometimes you picture me-- 
I'm walking too far ahead 
you're calling to me, I can't hear 
what you've said-- 
Then you say--go slow-- 
I fall behind-- 
the second hand unwinds 
if you're lost you can look--and you will find me 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting 
time after time 
after my picture fades and darkness has 
turned to gray 
watching through windows--you're wondering 
if I'm OK 
secrets stolen from deep inside 
the drum beats out of time-- 
if you're lost you can look--and you will find me 
time after time 
if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting 
time after time  
you said go slow-- 
I fall behind 
the second hand unwinds-- 
if you're lost you can look--and you will find me

My mind's a burnin' hell 
I got razors a rippin' and tearin' and strippin' 
My heart apart as well 
Tonight you told me 
That you ache for something new 
And some other woman is lookin' like something 
That might be good for you 
Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone 
Go on believe her when she tells you 
nothing's wrong 
But I'm the only one 
Who'll walk across the fire for you 
I'm the only one 
Who'll drown in my desire for you 
It's only fear that makes you run 
The demons that you're hiding from 
When all your promises are gone 
I'm the only one 
Please baby can't you see 
I'm trying to explain 
I've been here before and I'm locking the door 
And I'm not going back again

it go away

That holds you down today",Melissa Etheridge

Nothing to prove

Be the real love that I need

I'm searching for the real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Oh when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love

I've got to have a real love
Love so true and oh, baby

Towards a love my heart can feel

I can be your all and all

You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go

I gotta end it in this way
Because seems he can't be found

I want somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I want somebody who will understand 
When it comes to love I want a slow hand 
On shadowed ground with no one around 
And a blanket of stars in our eyes 
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves 
On the crazy wind of the night

You can tell your dog to bite my leg

Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind

The Flame,"Words and Music by Bob Mitchell and Nick Graham
Another night slowly closes in, 
And I feel so lonely.
Touching heat freezing on my skin, 
I pretend you still hold me.
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep.
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you.
I can't believe you're gone.
You were the first, you'll be the last.
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon. 
Remember: after the fire, after all the rain, 
I will be the flame. 
I will be the flame.
Watching shadows move across the wall, 
I feel so frightened.
I wanna run to you, I wanna call, 
But I've been hit by lightening.
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart.
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you.
You'll always be the one.
You were the first, you'll be the last.
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon. 
Remember: after the fire, after all the rain, 
I will be the flame.
I will be the flame.
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep.
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you.
You'll always be the one.
You were the first, you'll be the last.
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon. 
Remember: after the fire, after all the rain, 
I will be the flame.
I will be the flame.
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.
And whatever you want, I'll give it to you.",Cheap Trick

I Believe I Can Fly,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
[1] - I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
[Repeat 1]
Hey, cuz I believe in me, oh
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothign to it

Photograph,"Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times
I wonder if It's too late
Should i go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh oh oh
Oh god I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh god I

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it

Walkin' On The Sun,"It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack I know it went out but it's back.
It's just like any fad it retracts before impact
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with it and hip
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique
[Chorus:]
So don't delay act now supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer is shun you might as well be walkin' on the sun
Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin' man what the hell happened
Then some were spellbound some were hellbound
Some they fell down and some got back up and
Fought back 'gainst the melt down
And their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it
[Repeat Chorus]
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked

Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

Love Takes Time,"I had it all

Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly
[Chorus]
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do
Inside

Making Love Out Of Nothing At All,"I know just how to whisper,

I know just where to find the answers; 
and I know just how to lie. 
I know just how to fake it, 
and I know just how to scheme; 
I know just when to face the truth, 
and then I know just when to dream. 
And I know just where to touch you, 
and I know just what to prove; 
I know when to pull you closer, 
and I know when to let you loose. 
And I know the night is fading, 
and I know that time's gonna fly; 
and I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you, 
but I know I've got to give it a try. 
And I know the roads to riches, 
and I know the ways to fame; 
I know all the rules
and then I know how to break 'em 
and I always know the name of the game. 
But I don't know how to leave you, 
and I'll never let you fall; 
and I don't know how you do it,

and it's looking for a rhythm like you. 
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright. 
I've got to follow it, 'cause everything I know, well it's nothing till I give it to you. 
I can make the run or stumble, 
I can make the final block; 
And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle, 
I can make all the stadiums rock. 
I can make tonight forever, 
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn; 
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made, 
And I can make all your demons be gone. 
But I'm never gonna make it without you, 
Do you really want to see me crawl? 
And I'm never gonna make it like you do,

It's All Coming Back To Me Now,"There were nights when the wind was so cold that my body froze in bed if I just listened to it right outside the window. There were days when the sun was so cruel that all the tears turned to dust and I just knew my eyes were drying up forever.
I finished crying in the instant that you left and I can't remember where or when or how and I banished every memory you and I had ever made.
But when you touch me like this and you hold me like that, I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me. When I touch you like this and I hold you like that, it's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me.
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now. There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light. There were things I'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right. There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than any laws allow
Baby, Baby...
If I kiss you like this and if you whisper like that,
it was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me. If you want me like this and if you need me like that,
it was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me.
It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me.
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now.
But it's all coming back.
There were those empty threats and hollow lies and whenever you tried to hurt me, I'd just hurt you even worse and so much deeper. There were hours that just went on for days when alone at last, we'd count up all the chances that were lost to us forever.
But you were history with the slamming of the door and I made myself so strong again, somehow. And I never wasted any of my time on you since then.
But if I touch you like this and if you kiss me like that, it was so long ago but it's all coming back to me. If you touch me like this and if I kiss you like that, it was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me.
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now. There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light. There were things we'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right. There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than all your laws allow. Baby, baby, baby...
When you touch me like this and when you hold me like that, it was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me. When you see me like this and when I see you like that, then we see what we want to see, all coming back to me. The flesh and the fantasies, all coming back to me. I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now.
If you forgive me all this, if I forgive you all that, we forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me. When you see me like this and when I see you like that, we see just what we want to see, all coming back to me. The flesh and the fantasies, all coming back to me. I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now (it's all coming back to me now).
And when you kiss me like this (it's all coming back to me now) and when I touch you like that (it's all coming back to me now) and if you do it like this (it's all coming back to me now) and if we...",Celine Dion 
Tainted Love,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away
I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my life
For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you, now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I gave you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not really all
Tainted love, ohh, tainted love
Now I know I've got to
Run away
I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right you need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you, now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I gave you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not really all
Tainted love, ohh, tainted love
Don't touch me please, I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Ohh, tainted love (repeat)

They Don't Know,"Heard about my past

We'll make heaven a place on earth

I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice
And it carries me
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Insensitive,"How do you cool your lips 
after a summer's kiss 
how do you rid the sweat 
after the body bliss 
How do you turn your eyes 
from the romantic glare 
how do you block the sound 
of a voice you'd know anywhere 
Oh, I really should have known 
by the time you drove me home 
by the vagueness in your eyes 
casual good-byes 
by the chill in your embrace 
the expression on your face 
that told me 
you might have some advice to give 
on how to be 
insensitive 
How do you numb your skin 
after the warmest touch 
how do you slow your blood 
after the body rush 
how do you free your soul 
after you've found a friend 
how do you teach your heart 
it's a crime to fall in love again 
Oh, you probably won't remember me 
it's probably ancient history 
I'm one of the chosen few 
who went ahead and fell for you 
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch 
I fell too fast, I feel too much 
I thought that you might have 
some advice to give on how to be

Girl I'm Gonna Miss You,"Hey, at least these lyrics are real!
I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You rapped me 'round your little bitty finger
With your magic smile
You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while
You put your spell on me
Took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you
All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl
I'm gonna miss you baby
Giving all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time

It's a tragedy for me
To see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl I'm gonna miss you
Like a honey bee
You look the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale
You are so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal
When you had a taste of paradise
Back on earth can feel
As cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you

But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday oo someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time
When you're cold and lonely
Baby how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when you're down
In your time of need
And you're thinking
That you might be coming back to own me
Just think again

Hotel California,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair 
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air 
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light 
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim 
I had to stop for the night 
There she stood in the doorway; 
I heard the mission bell 
And I was thinking to myself, 
'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell' 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor, 
I thought I heard them say... 
Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place 
Such a lovely face 
Plenty of room at the Hotel California 
Any time of year, you can find it here 
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends 
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends 
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. 
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget 
So I called up the Captain, 
'Please bring me my wine' 
He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine' 
And still those voices are calling from far away, 
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say... 
Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place 
Such a lovely face 
They livin' it up at the Hotel California 
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis 
Mirrors on the ceiling, 
The pink champagne on ice 
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device' 
And in the master's chambers, 
They gathered for the feast 
The stab it with their steely knives, 
But they just can't kill the beast 
Last thing I remember, I was 
Running for the door 
I had to find the passage back 
To the place I was before 
'Relax,'said the night man, 
We are programmed to receive.

but you can never leave!",Eagles

Knock You Down,"[Keri Hilson:]
Heh... not again...
Oh... this ain't supposed to happen to me...
[Kanye West:]
Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vouiton-ed up or Reebok-in'
You see the hate, that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have - desert or disaster?
[Keri Hilson:]
I never thought I'd... be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
And you came in... and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race
But I... already won first place
I never thought I'd... fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin' about our life, house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down... knocked me down
[Chorus:]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

And it knocks you down

[Ne-Yo:]
I've never thought I
Would hear myself say (ooh)
Ya'll gon head
I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high (flyin' high)
Til I met this pretty little missle, that shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)
(Hey) Till now I'm crashing, I don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never to much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
[Chorus:]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

[Kanye West:]
Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams to
Seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin'
We, were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick... hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess have asked someone that's only average
For advice
O.M.G, you listen to that, bitch?
Whoa it's me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him
[Keri Hilson:]
So I gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So I'll bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh Cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoaa, whoaaa
I'll admit it, I I was scared to answer loves call
Whoaa, whoaaa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall
(When it comes around)
[Chorus:]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love come and knocks you down (oh)
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (yeah)",Keri Hilson

Here Without You,"A hundred days had made me older
since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lights had made me colder

They disappeared now when I'm dreaming of your face
I'm here without you baby
but your still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
but your still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me
The miles just keep rolling
as the people either way to say hello
I hear this life is overrated
but I hope it gets better as we go
I'm here without you baby
but your still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
but your still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl it's only you and me
Everything I know, and anywhere I go 
it gets hard but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done
it get hard but it won't take away my love
I'm here without you baby
but your still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
and I dream about you all the time

I want a brand new house 
on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough 
for ten plus me
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club 
At thirty-seven thousand feet
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars

In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's 
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny 
With her bleach blond hair
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs 
So I can eat my meals for free
I think I'm gonna dress my ass 
with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to 
blow my money for me

Up Where We Belong,"Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world where few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real
I keep it alive
The road is long
There are mountains in the way
But we climb a step every day
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Up where the clear winds blow
Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives looking behind
When all we have is here and now
All our lives
Out there to find
The road is long
There are mountains in the way
But we climb a step every day
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Up where the clear winds blow
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive... today
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know

Lonely No More,"Now it seems to me

You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
Now its hard for me with my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony 
Girl, what you do to me is everything 
Make me say anything; just to get you back again
Why can we just try

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
What if I was good to you, what if you were good to me
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
What if it was paradise, what if we were symphonies
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you

You Haven't Done Nothin',"We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"";You haven't done nothing"";!
It's not too cool to be ridiculed 
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views

Ridin',"[Intro - Chamillionaire]
I'm lookin in my rearview
And I can see a clearer view of you
This is the remix...
I see you waitin, I know you hatin...
[Chorus - Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight
[Chamillionaire]
Ch-Chea! Chamillitary mayne... uh, yeah
I got 20 grand in my pocket and, I'm ridin around with my pockets crammed
You the one that got the contraband, and you smokin that like you in Amsterdam
Before I know it, I see them sirens, I'm pullin over - aye, we just ridin!
Don't talk back, won't be no violence, just shut up, and sit in your seat in silence
Now the police is searchin who? They searchin me and then they searchin you
They smell the breeze and you smell like trees
cause you hit the blunt and hit the purple too
Now the lie is irreversable because you just told 'em we were ridin clean
They question you, but they ain't question me yet
I'm thinkin the police ain't find a thing
Standin on the side of the freeway, wishin they would just hurry up
And I can see, you walkin up to me, like he about to put me up in them cuffs
I turned around and I look at you, and you look away like you feelin sick
I'm goin to jail for what I didn't comit, I must admit, that I hate a snitch
[Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty (Cause I'm ridin dirty)
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight (jail tonight)
[Chamillionaire]
Ever since they heard the song ridin dirty
The whole world been listenin I'm glad you heard me
Some cops that representin the badge
been showin me every cop ain't bad or tryin to scurr me
A year after ""White and Nerdy""
On the grind, still tryin, still flyin birdies
That stuff still in ya cup, still drivin swervin
Ridin dirty like the vehicle inside the derby
A little inspired by U.G.K, and the rest inspired by the life I'm livin
Seen that Impala, he was drunk
And that's when I saw the red lights go get em
And it's ironic that during the chase
Seen Murder Chase, and this kid was Christian
Movin target ran across the street
And unfortunately the car didn't miss him
And now the family is soon to know, that they gon have to do another funeral
The angels ain't singin to ya tune no more, don't move too fast, baby move it slow
Cause one day ya here, baby... next thing ya know, next thing ya know
Everything that used to move don't move no more
[Chorus - Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight
[Outro - Chamillionaire]
This is not a movie, it's real life, yeah, yeah...
It's real life, it ain't just a song, it's a message
Nobody ever opens they eyes till somebody gets killed

Another  fat,  fat  track  So  Rhythm  D,  pour  the  orange  juice  
And  let's  relax  while  sippin'  on  yak  Because  it's  like  that  
I'm  causious  of  ho's,  so  Paperboy  wears  prophilatic  
I  wear  a  jimmy  for  the  skins  Cuz  it's  a  long  trip  
Front  row  seats,  aiyo  I  know  she's  on  the  nine  inch  
Just  to  get  a  peice  of  the  green  But  she's  an  undertaker  
Now  you  know  the  Paper  is  an  around  the  world  heart-breaker  
If  you  think  I  fell  for  yo,  had  to  have  a  breakdown  
Playin'  you  fools,  so  now  you  know  why  my  belly's  round  
Takin'  the  rap  back  up  and  scoopin'  up  crowds  just  like  a  steel  shovel 
Not  from  the  ghetto,  but  yo,  takin'  it  to  another  level  
Let  the  beat  ride,  but  hold  on  to  your  women,  G  
Cuz  now  that  I'm  rich  so  many  women  wanna  do  me  
It  make  a  man  say  ""damn""  
I'm  finally  taxin'  more  play  than  homey  Sam  
But  let  me  speak  to  the  weak,  I  mean  the  rookies  
My  time  is  help  up,  extremely  for  cookies  
Just  let  me  clock  this  groove  in  ninety  two  
Hey,  you  don't  bother  me  and  I  sure  'nuff  won't  bother  you  
And  ah,  you  just  watch  a  brother  flowin'  like  Niagra  
Think  before  you  step,  because  these  lyrics  just  might  stag  ya  
Although  I'm  labeled  with  the  black  fade  
It's  gold  d's  on  my  foreign  gold  lex,  cuz  I  got  it  made  
I  broke  the  beat  once  again  because  I  had  to  
And  just  like  Jody  Watley,  baby  girl,  I  can  have  you  
Just  let  me  work  this  track,  and  yo,  any  way  is  ok  
Your  place  or  mine,  all  night  until  the  next  day  
Unh  
Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Now  here  we  go  from  the  top  
Second  verse  of  the  same  song  
With  the  conclusion,  I  should  be  out  before  the  ding-dong.  
It's  just  a  mad  park  a  grip,  G  
It's  like  every  nickel  and  dime  nigga  be  like  
""See,  don't  you  remember  me?""  
A  hustler,  and  it's  on  with  more  hoes  to  play  low  
Keep  'em  chunky  like  Prego,  so  they  can  leggo  with  my  eggo  
I  have  a  tendancy  to  flow,  start  off  with  my  own  groove  
Pick  up  the  mic,  and  all  of  a  sudden,  I  see  high  movin'  
Guess  it's  like  magic,  and  Paperboy  is  the  magician  
If  I  was  a  vaccum  I'd  be  suckin'  up  competition  
Let  it  ride  again,  and  yo,  belive  I  got  my  own  thing  
Straight  Bahama  hoes  so  miss  me  with  the  chick  from  Soul  Train  
And  I'm  a  break  my  note,  just  to  show  up  token  
Tote  on  his  ass  when  I  scoop  him,  cuz  we  bud  smokin'  
A  black  man  tryin'  to  make  it  and  that  ain't  no  fair  
But  just  like  BeBe  and  CeCe,  I'll  take  you  there  
Huh  
Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Now  here  we  go  
Uh,  let's  take  a  trip  to  another  land  
Park  a  grip,  come  back  and  watch  the  hoes  tan  
Jump  in  the  lex-o,  and  roll  out  to  my  cabin  
Believe  me,  my  brother,  more  hoes  than  you  can  imagine  
All  on  the  ding-a-ling,  just  because  the  gold  rings  
But  I'm  like  a  supah  choke,  you  ain't  heard  a  damn  thing  
Make  sure  you  got  the  jim  hats,  strapped  for  protection  
Because  to  me,  my  life  is  more  than  my  erection  
And  give  me  a  hand,`if  you  a  fan,  it  ain't  over  yet  
Cuz  doin'  the  ditty  with  Paperboy  makes  the  ocean  sweat  
Leave  you  kinda  startled  like  the  funk  off  of  fritos  
Make  you  man  jealous,  while  hoes  cheese  like  Doritos  
It  ain't  my  fault,  I  lay  the  piper  with  concern  
And  I  ain't  from  Mount  Vernon,  but  a  brother's  money-earnin'  
And  for  those  disagree,  and  then  jack,  that's  a  pitty  
Just  bob  your  head  for  Paperboy  and  the  ditty  
Yeah  
Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you",Paperboy

Our Song,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says baby is something wrong?
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
And he says...
[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When you're on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""man, I didn't kiss her, but I should have""
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything the day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said...
[Repeat Chorus]
I've heart every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date ""man, I didn't kiss him, and I could have""
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I... wrote down our song",Taylor Swift

Part-Time Lover,"Call up, ring once, hang up the phone 
To let me know you made it home 
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 
If she's with me I'll blink the lights 
To let you know tonight's the night 
For me and you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
Know the word's "";discreet""; when part-time lovers 
But if there's some emergency 
Have a male friend to ask for me 
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell 
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
And it was not you my part-time lover 
And then a man called our exchange 
But didn't want to leave his name 
I guess that two can play the game 
Of part-time lovers 
You and me, part-time lovers

Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
[Chorus:]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line 
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we have the beat of times
When love was young and new 
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you
We'll never lose it again

You never let it end

fragile but free

tender together
if not so in love
and it's not so wrong

they add to your confusion
oh and you need to hear
the time that told the truth

I Don't Wanna Know,"[P. Diddy - talking]

Oh baby 
I think about it when I hold you 
When lookin in your eyes, I can't believe

Baby keep it to yourself

Baby I just don't get it 
Do you enjoy being hurt? 
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right 
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are) 
[Chorus:]
You should let me love you 
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection 
Make me your selection 
Show you the way love's supposed to be 
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you 
[Verse 2:]
Listen
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts 
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame 
Don't even know what you're worth 
Everywhere you go they stop and stare 
Cause you're bad and it shows 
From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know 
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right

We should be together girl (baby)
With me and you it's whatever girl, hey!
So can we make this thing ours?

Cool It Now,"Everybody's saying, seeing things 
Without knowing that life brings a change 
And they've been checking all the time 
My friends say I'm love sick cause I...

Cause all I keep thinking about is her in my arms 
And I won't feel the same until she is mine

Love So Right,"She came on like the night and she held on tight 
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend , started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone 
Now I'm hanging on 
Maybe you can tell me how a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on , on the chance that you'll come back to me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
It isn't really fair
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling 
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling (repeat/fade)",Bee Gees 
Wasting My Time,"Well I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away

Afraid to feel

And take it all again
Woah again

When did our light turn from green to red
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again
Well this is not for real

Lonesome, lonely
See you waiting

Good Luck Charm,"Don't want a four leaf clover
Don't want an old horse shoe
Want your kiss 'cause I just can't miss

Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm

To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
Don't want a silver dollar

The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm 
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say

Island Girl,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 
I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey so sweet 
Down where Lexington cross 47th Street 
She's a big girl, she's standing six foot three 
Turning tricks for the dudes in the big city 
Island girl 
What you wanting with the white man's world 
Island girl 
Black boy want you in his island world 
He want to take you from the racket boss 
He want to save you but the cause is lost 
Island girl, island girl, island girl 
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's world 
She's black as coal but she burn like a fire 
And she wrap herself around you like a well worn tire 
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake

Lips Of An Angel,"Honey why are you calling me so late 
It's kinda hard to talk right now 
Honey why are you crying is everything okay 
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud 
Well, my girls in the next room 
Sometimes I wish she was you 
I guess we never really moved on 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name 
It sounds so sweet 
Coming from the lips of an angel 
Hearing those words it makes me weak 
And I never wanna say goodbye 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 
It's funny that you're calling me tonight 
And yes I've dreamt of you too 
And does he know you're talking to me 
Will it start a fight 
No I don't think she has a clue 
Well my girls in the next room 
Sometimes I wish she was you 
I guess we never really moved on 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name 
It sounds so sweet 
Coming from the lips of an angel 
Hearing those wordsa it makes me weak 
And I never wanna say goodbye 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name

Got To Give It Up (Part 1),"I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
And my body yearned to be free
So I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me
No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball
Long as you prove it
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
I'm gonna make romance
With your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
Get down and prove it, feel all right

Never Gonna Let You Go,"I was as wrong as I could be to let you get away from me

All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word and tell me that I'm forgiven
You and me
We're gonna be better than we were before
I loved you then but now I intend
To open up and love you even more
This time you can be sure
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all and I took it for granted
But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love that still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances
Wait and see
It's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to giving more

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever

Love On The Rocks,"Written by: Neil Diamond and Gilbert Becaud
Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose
So you just sing the blues all the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in the storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when you're love's on the rocks
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in the storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away

To Sir With Love,"Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'
Those awkward years have hurried by, why did they fly, fly away? 
Why is it Sir, children grow up to be people one day?
What takes the place of climbing trees, 
And dirty knees, in the world outside? 
What, what is there that I can buy? 
If you wanted the world, 
I'd surround it with a wall, I'd scrawl 
These words with letters ten feet tall 
To you, with love 
The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?
If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir,
With Love'",Lulu

Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Would you still have love for me

Would you still have love for me

If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like 
some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Are you my soulmate 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me Or up and leave me
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone
And always remember girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Love Story,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashbacks starts
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""please don't go""
And I said
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""please don't go""
And I said
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""
Oh, ohh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in thy head, I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""

I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess, and I don't mean maybe - please

We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice, please

Just how good he's been treating me

Doo Wop (That Thing),"It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down then you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him
If you did it then, then you probably f*** again
Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hardrock when you're really a gem
Babygirl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas f***ed up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen
Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of their three and four kids men
They facing a court case when the child's support late
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the s***n stop acting like boys and be men
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing",Lauryn Hill 
She's So High,"(T.  Bachman)
She's blood, flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone

But somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's gonna happen
'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high, high above me
First class and fancy free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother?

Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me

Burning love

I'd Really Love To See You Tonight,"(John Lennon & Paul McCartney)
Help, I need somebody,
help, not just anybody,
help, you know I need someone, help.
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
won't you please, please help me.
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
won't you please, please help me.
When I was younger, so much younger than today,

All I Wanna Do,"Hit it!
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours,
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon but
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard",Sheryl Crow

Another Night,"Chorus: 
Another night, another dream, but always you, 
it's like a vision of love that seems to be true, 
Another night another dream, but always you, 
in the night I dream of love so true. 
Just another night, another vision of love, 
you feel joy, you feel pain, cuz nothing will be the same. 
Just another night, is all that it takes,
to understand, the difference between lovers and fakes, 
so baby, I talk talk, I talk to you, 
in the night in your dream, of love so true. 
I talk talk, I talk to you, 
in the night in your dream, of love so true. 
In the night, in my dreams, 
I'm in love with you, cuz you talk to me like lovers do,
I feel joy I feel pain, cuz it's still the same,
when the night is gone I'll be alone.
Chorus 
Just another night, another dream, another vision,
of love, with me, 
I'm here to set you free I am your lover, your brother,
hey sister let me cover, your body with my love is with my lovin' just another,
vision of love, that seems to be true, all we do all the things that only lovers do,
vision of love, that seems to be true, all we do all the things that only lovers do.
In the night in my dreams I'm in love with you,
cuz you talk to me like lovers do, I feel joy I feel pain, 
cuz it's still the same, when the night is gone I'll be alone. 
Chorus 
I talk talk, I talk to you in the night,
in your dream, of love so true.
I talk talk, I talk to you, in the night, in your dream, of love so true.
In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you,
cuz you talk to me like lovers do, I feel joy I feel pain
cuz it's still the same, when the night is gone I'll be alone.

Come To My Window,"Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light
of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
I would dial the numbers
Just to listen to your breath
I would stand inside my hell
And hold the hand of death
You don't know how far I'd go
To ease this precious ache
You don't know how much I'd give
Or how much I can take
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light
of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
Keeping my eyes open
I cannot afford to sleep
Giving away promises
I know that I can't keep
Nothing fills the blackness
That has seeped into my chest
I need you in my blood
I am forsaking all the rest
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh to reach you
Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light
of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
I don't care what they think
I don't care what they say
What do they know about this
love anyway
Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light
of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon",Melissa Etheridge

in fact no brotherman here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me,
but it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only,
know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr.Wendal, that's his name,
no one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,
until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges,
still most of y'all come out confused

Mr.Wendal has freedom,
a free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
for Mr.Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
and an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him,
but I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no ?
Who are we to judge ?
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
and killed over a racist grudge
Mr.Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
but we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far,
and we got too far, cause on him we walk

realize that all in all you stand tall

Behind These Hazel Eyes,"Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again

Those Were The Days,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la...
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la...
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la...
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

I'll find some peace tonight

you are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort there
so tired of the straight line
and everywhere you turn
there's vultures and thieves at your back
and the storm keeps on twisting
you keep on building the lie
that you make up for all that you lack
it don't make no difference
escaping one last time
it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees
in the arms of an angel
fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room
and the endlessness that you fear
you are pulled from the wreckage

Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And be can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah",Elvis Presley 
Drive,"Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear  
And I cant help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer  
It's driven me before, it seems to have a vague  
Haunting mass appeal  
Lately I'm beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there  
So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive  
Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive, oh oh  
It's driven me before, it seems to be the way  
That everyone else get around  
Lately, I'm beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there  
Would you choose water over wine  
Hold the wheel and drive  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there",Incubus 
Mouth,"I feel like I've been blown apart.
There are pieces here I don't know where they go 
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips 
I bet you feel a little crazy but for me 
We'll be famous on t.v. 
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would it be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to tast it 
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it 
I jump on you, you jump on me 
You push me aut and even though you know 
I love you I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth 
When I kiss your salty lips 
You will feel a little crazy 
But for me I'll be famous on t.v. 
Now, will it be my fault 
If I take your love and throw it wide? 
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart 
All the pieces there will fit to make you whole 
And I know where they go",Merril Bainbridge 
P.I.M.P.,"I don't know what you heard about me

No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars 
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada

I spit a little G man, and my game got her 
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada 
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her 
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her 
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk 
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York? 
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head 
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread 
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed 
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid 
Look baby this is simple, you can't see? 
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P

Head full of hair, bitch I'm a P-I-M-P 
Come get money with me, if you curious to see 
how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P 
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV 
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P 
Girl we could pop the champagne and we could have a ball 
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all 
We could really splurge girl and tear up the mall 
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call 
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall 
If you got problems I can solve'em, they big or they small 
That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit 
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch 
[chorus] 
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools 
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels 
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused 
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes 
I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper 
Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her 
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know 
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low 
Bitch choose on me, I'll have you stripping in the street 
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat 
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread 
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head 
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch 
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six 
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch 
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

In the hood they say, there's no b'ness like hoe b'ness ya know 
They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster

If You Wanna Be Happy,"If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life

So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
A pretty woman makes her husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he marries her then she starts
To do the things that will break his heart
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
you'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
And she'll always give you peace of mind

Tell It Like It Is,"If you want something to play with 
Go and find yourself a toy

And I'm not a little boy 
If you are serious 
Don't play with my heart 
It makes me furious 
But if you want me to love you 
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will 
Tell it like it is 
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide 
But I know deep down inside me 
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride 
Life is too short to have sorrow 
You may be here today and gone tomorrow 
You might as well get what you want 
So go on and live, baby go on and live

Total Eclipse Of The Heart,"Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never comin' round. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit nervouse that the best of all the years have gone by. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.
And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever and if you'll only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever and we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong together. We can take it to the end of the line. Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time. I don't know what to do, I'm always in the dark. We're living in a power keg and giving off sparks. I really need you tonight. Forever's gonna start tonight. Forever's gonna start tonight.
Once upon a time, I was falling in love. Now I'm only falling apart. There's nothing I can do. A total eclipse of the heart. Once upon a time, there was light in my life. Now there's only love in the dark. Nothing I can say. A total eclipse of the heart.
Turn around bright eyes. Turn around bright eyes.
Turn around, every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be.  Turn around, every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am. Turn around, every now and then I know there's no one in the universe who's as magical and wondrous as you. Turn around, every now and then I know there's nothing any better, there's nothing that I just wouldn't do. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.
And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever and if you'll only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever and we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong together.

Dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight
you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
to try and slag me down because I know I'm right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing
was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just
not right
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found

Love Is In The Air,"* Love is in the air 
everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being
Foolish don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in and it's there
When I look in your eyes
Love is in the air, in the whisper of the tree,
Love is in the air in thethunder of the sea,
And I don't know if I'm just dreaming,
Don't know if I feel safe,
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name
Love is in the air, love is in the air,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh
Love is in the air, in the rising of the sun,
Love is in the air,
When the day is nearly done,
And I don't know if you are illusion,
Don't know if I see truth,
But you are something
That I must believe in, and you are there
When I reach out for you

Shame On The Moon,"Words and Music by Rodney Crowell 
Until you've been beside a man 
You don't know what he wants 
You don't know if he cries at night 
You don't know if he don't 
When nothin comes easy 
Old nightmares are real 
Until you' ve been beside a man 
You don't know how he feels 
Once inside a woman's heart 
A man must keep his head 
Heaven opens up the door 
Where angels fear to tread 
Some men go crazy 
Some men go slow 
Some men go just where they want 
Some men never go 
Oh blame it on midnight 
Ooh shame on the moon 
Everywhere it's all around 
Comfort in a crowd 
Strangers faces all around 
Laughin right out loud 
Hey watch where your goin 
Step light on old toes 
Cause until you've been beside a man 
You don't know who he knows 
Oh blame it on midnight 
Ooh shame on the moon 
Oh blame it on midnight",Bob Seger 
Fortunate,"[Verse1:]
Never seen a sun shine like this 
Never seen the moon glow like this 
Never seen the waterfalls like this 
Never seen the lights off like this 
Never dug anyone like this 
Never had tasty lips to kiss 
Never had someone to miss 
Never wrote a song quite like this 
[Chorus:]
Fortunate to have you girl, 
I'm so glad you're in my world, 
Just as sure as the sky is blue, 
I bless the day that I found you. 
[Verse 2:]
Never had room service all night 
Never took a trip first class flight 
Never had a love affair so tight 
I've never felt a feeling so right 
Never seen a winter so white 
Never had words to recite 
Never had a flame to ignite 
And I never sang a song with all my might. 
[chorus 2x]
Silence child hope you hear 
I'm callin out to your body 
Baby you know just what to do 
Close the door no interlude

West End Girls,"(....forever)
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head

Running down underground to a dive bar

Maggie May,"Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you 
It's late September and I really should be back at school 
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used 
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more 
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone 
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt 
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age 
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything 
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax 
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more 
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone 
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without 
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand 
But you turned into a lover and 
mother what a lover, you wore me out 
All you did was wreck my bed 
and in the morning kick me in the head 
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore 
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone 
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried 
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school 
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool 
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand 
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face 
You made a first-class fool out of me 
But I'm as blind as a fool can be 
You stole my heart but I love you anyway 
Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face 
I'll get on back home one of these days",Rod Stewart 
Coming Out Of The Dark,"Why be afraid if I'm not alone
Though life is never easy the rest in unkown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
It's shinning on me
Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me
Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step I'll make it through I know I can
It may not make it easier but I have felt you
Near all the way

Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love
Forever I'll stand on the rock
Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

Rhythm Of The Night,"(Jackson Browne)
When you look over your shoulder
And you see the life that you've left behind
When you think it over do you ever wonder?
What it is that holds your life so close to mine
You love the thunder and you love the rain
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain
And before the lightning fades and you surrender
You've got a second to look at the dark side of the man
You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
And I know you wonder how you ever came
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame
Draw the shade and light the fire
For the night that holds you and calls your name
And just like your lover, knows your desire
And the crazy longing that time will never tame
You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
I got your number if it's still the same
You can dream
But you can never go back the way you came",DeBarge

Sunny Came Home,"by Shawn Colvin   John Leventhal 
Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission
She says days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said 
Sunny came home with a vengeance
She says days go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it
Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own and she's alright
Sunny came home
Sunny came home...",Shawn Colvin

Ooh say what, say what, say what 
(Uh, uh, uh, Left Eye) 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
(Donell Jones) 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
[Donell] 
Me and my niggaz be rolling 
Trailing on you and your homies 
The very first day of summer 
All chromed out in a hummer babe 
Hit the park and parle 
Hope that your off is away 
Cause you and your girls wanna ride 
Play all day, puff on the lye 
1 - [Donell] 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
(You know that I like it baby) 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
(And you know what I need) 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
(You know that I'm bout it baby) 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
(Ooh) 
2 - [Donell] 
I'm digging you, I'm feeling you 
And you know what's up 
Said I'm big on you and I'm wanting you 
So tell me what's up 
Be 'bout five niggaz zoning 
Running around two in the morning 
Looking fly with that sun dress on 
I think I feel a bone coming on 
Girl you got me wide open 
Fiending all day and I'm hoping 
So baby don't front 
Back seat jeep, you know what I want 
Repeat 1 
Repeat 2 
[Left Eye] 
Uh, say what? say what? say what? 
So baby tell me what's up 
Can we ascend to higher heights 
And when the path gets rough 
We can give into Friday nights breath we peace 
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap 
Our souls to keep 
The passion's deep and filled with heat 
Living this life on the hustle I barely get enough time 
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine 
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world 
A reputation known as the untouchable girl 
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways 
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days 
Now we can play, past ways, or just ain't got time 
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine 
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by 
You and I don't need permission to be unified 
Surely I done seen and heard a million places 
Then I travel around the world, see many faces 
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true 
You can show me that nobody else can do it better than you 
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got 
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots 
Repeat 2 till end

Love Will Lead You Back,"(Diane Warren)
Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know
(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh, how much you miss me
You walked out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
Oh, darling I know
Oh, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home
(repeat chorus)But I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah
(repeat chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back",Taylor Dayne 
It Wasn't Me,"(feat. Ricardo Ducent)
(Yo', man) Yo'
(Open up, man) What do you want, man
(My girl just caught me) You let her catch you
(I don't know how I let this happen) With who
(The girl next door, you know) Man
(I don't know what to do) Say it wasn't you
(Alright)
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)
She said our dealy was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her
From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me
Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on da right prefix 
Whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein is believin so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Wait for your answer: go over there 
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)
She said our dealy was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry 
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin to your reasonin
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key

Hard Habit To Break,"I guess I thought you'd be here forever

You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him 
Two people together but living alone 
I was spreading my love too thin 
After all of these years

But deep in the night it's an endless flight 
I can't get ya out of my mind

Sine the moment I spetted you
Like walking round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies... and it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied
[Pre-Chorus:]
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Seems like everything I say to you
Comes otu wrong and never comes out right
[Chorus:]
So I'll say 'why don't you and I get togehter and take on the world
and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon
and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never going to let me in
And slowly I begin to realize this is never going to end
Right about the same you walk by
And I say 'Oh here we go again'
When's thisever going to break
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
And it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud

Time (Clock Of The Heart),"Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears
Chorus 1:
In time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show
Chorus 2:
Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch we touch was the heat too much
I felt I lost you from the start

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

And it was all that you've given me

And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me""

Oh lord, there must be something you can say

Probably been moved on from every place

One love feeds the fire, one heart burns desire, I wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run, who'll be the lonely one, I wonder who's cryin' now

Neither could change their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage, they tore another page
The fightin' is worth the love they save

Wind Of Change,"Lyrics:Klaus Meine
I folow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change
The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away

Blinded By The Light,"Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer
With a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder
Feeling kinda older
I tripped a merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing
Sneezing and wheezing
The calliope crashed to the ground
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight
She's gonna make it through the night
Some silicone sister
With her manager mister
Told me I've got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny to
something strong
Play the song with the funky break
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in her curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride
Mama always told me not to look into
the eyes of the sun
But mama that's where the fun is
Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funnybone
That's where they expect it least
And some new mown chaperone
Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sewn moonstone
Was messin' with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance",Manfred Mann's Earth Band

On Blue Bayou

With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again

By my side

And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day

Workin' for The Man ev'ry night and day,
And I never lost one minute of sleepin',
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been.

Big wheel keep on turnin',

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans,
But I never saw the good side of the city,
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen.

If you come down to the river,
Bet you gonna find some people who live.
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money,
People on the river are happy to give.

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"Virgil Caine is my name and I drove on the Danville train
'til so much cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Back with my wife in Tenesse
And one day she said to me,
""Virgil, Quick! Come see!
There goes Robert E. Lee.""
Now I don't mind, I'm chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
Like my father before me, I'm a working man
And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
Oh, he was just 18, proud and brave
But a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood below my feet
You can't raise a Cane back up when he's in defeat",Joan Baez 
Love Is Like Oxygen,"Time on my side 
I got it all 
I've heard that pride 
Always comes before a fall 
There's a rumour goin' round the town 
That you don't want me around 
I can't shake off my city blues 
Everyway I turn I lose 
Chorus 
Love is like oxygen 
You get too much you get too high 
Not enough and you're gonna die 
Love gets you high 
Time is no healer 
When you're not there

Some things are better left unsaid 
I'm gonna spend my days in bed 
I'll walk the streets at night

We Belong Together,"I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't
Hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause baby
[Chorus:]
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please, 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
'If you think you're lonely now'
Wait a minute
This is too deep, too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life baby

You Belong With Me,"You're on the phone
With your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about
Something that you said
She doesn't get your humor
Like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music
She doesn't like
She'll never know your story
Like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
When you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see
That i'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you
See you belong with me
You belong with me.
Walking the streets
With you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking
This is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
Thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine
I know you better than that
Hey whatchu doing
With a girl like that
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
When you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see
That i'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you
See you belong with me
Standing by and
Waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know
Baby
You belong with me
You belong with me.

Oh, I remember
You driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see
That i'm the one
Who understands
Been here all along
So why can't you see?
You belong with me.

Just maybe

Guess I had to lose you

burn a little stronger?

I don't wanna find somebody new. 
I don't wanna live without your love,

Crying In The Chapel,"You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth 
To gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees
Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord
You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find 
No way on earth 
To gain peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way",Elvis Presley

I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
The world is always changing
Nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in
Remains to be seen
Will you be by my side
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life

written by:   George Merril/Sharon Rubican
I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why
I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you
     Trying to catch your heart
     Is like trying to catch a star
     So many people love you baby
     That must be what you are
          Waiting for a star to fall
          And carry your heart into my arms
          That's where you belong
          In my arms baby, yeah
I've learned to feel what I cannot see
But with you I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in superstition
I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free
     Trying to catch your heart
     Is like trying to catch a star
     But I can't love you this much baby
     And love you from this far
          Waiting for a star to fall
          And carry your heart into my arms
          That's where you belong
          In my arms baby, yeah
Waiting (however long...)
I don't like waiting (I'll wait for you...)
It's so hard waiting (don't be too long...)
Seems like waiting (makes me love you even more...)
          Waiting for a star to fall
          And carry your heart into my arms
          That's where you belong
          In my arms baby, yeah",Boy Meets Girl

Heartbreak Hotel,"This is the heartbreak hotel [9x]
You said that you'd be here by nine 
And said you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why you do this to me
[Chorus 1 (sung by Faith Evans)]
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is hat I have to say: 
All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you play with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me
Now I see that you been doing wrong 
You played me all along. 
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me. 
How could you do it to me

Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down 
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail 
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannon balls fly 
Before they're forever banned? 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
How many years must a mountain exist 
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist 
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head 
And pretend that he just doesn't see? 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
How many times must a man look up 
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have 
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows 
That too many people have died?

Tonight ooo I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine

Suppressed by all of my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Because your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
But now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
And though you're still with me
I've been alone all along",Evanescence

You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do? 
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
My head is saying, "";Fool, forget him.""; 
My heart is saying, "";Don't let go. 
Hold on till the end."";

Keep my hand in the fire

And then change my mind

And leave you behind

Sorry but I gotta be strong

Love gives you the right to be free 
You said be patient, just wait a little longer 
But that's just an old fantasy 
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door 
For tonight is the night, for feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through

When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor

So when life get hot in july it's the world against you and I

She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us

with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!
[Chorus]
[Beyonce]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfried
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody was me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

Somebody To Love,"When the truth is found to be lies 
and all the joy wittin you dies.
Don't you want somebody to love.
Don't you need somebody to love.
Wouldn't you love somebody to love.
You'ld better find sombody to love.
When the garden flowers baby are dead, yes 
and your mind, your mind is so full of bread.
Don't you want somebody to love.
Don't you need somebody to love.
Wouldn't you love somebody to love.
You'ld better find sombody to love.
Your eyes, i see it, your eyes may look like this,
but in your head, baby, i'm afraid you don't know where it is.
Don't you want somebody to love.
Don't you need somebody to love.
Wouldn't you love somebody to love.

The Living Years,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't  get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye",Mike + The Mechanics

BOY, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I DON'T CARE
OR ARE YOU LOOKING RIGHT THROUGH ME
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LATELY (SEEMS TO ME THAT LATELY)
YOU LOOK AT ME THE WRONG WAY AND I START TO CRY
COULD IT BE THAT MAYBE (COULD IT BE THAT MAYBE)
THIS CRAZY SITUATION IS THE REASON WHY
I DON'T CARE WHO'S WRONG OR RIGHT
I DON'T REALLY WANNA FIGHT NO MORE
TOO MUCH TALKING BABE
DON'T CARE NOW WHO'S TO BLAME
I DON'T REALLY WANNA FIGHT NO MORE
THIS IS TIME FOR LETTING GO

BUT WE JUST GREW APART

Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day...
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing I learned 
Is that I need you desperately...
So here I am 
And can you please tell me... oh
[Chorus:]
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms 
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
I've been around enough to know 
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away...
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know...

And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in Rapture
Back to back

Spinless movement
And a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping

DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Francois sez fas, Flashe' no do

Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and you drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe
Don't move to slow, 'cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door, hall to hall

Man to man, body muscular
Sismic decibel by the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology and a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

Walked Outta Heaven,"[Verse 1 (Brian):]
I'm rolling down a lonely highway asking god to please forgive me for messing up tha blessing he gave to me, i see,
Everything clearer now the nights is black as, black as its ever been
Without my girl, imma lose it, i pray that he would just shed his grace on me, i need just to be back with my baby
[Chorus:]
Feel like i just walked right out of heaven
Feel like i have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea 
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Dont know what to do, gotta get right wit you
Feel like i just walked right out of heaven
Feel like i have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea 
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Dont know what to do, feel like i just walk right out of heaven
[Verse 2 (Brandon):]
See my mamma told me thats if its meant to be she'll come back and she'll forgive me and the best thing i can do it to just
Let her, let her go i know, i don't wanna do it
But if i continue to push she'll just pull away and i know that in my heart its a reality i didn't treat her like she wanted
To be treated, and i hope that shes not gone for good no no
[Chorus]
[Bridge 1:]
Hey girl waiting for you all the time, suppose to move on with my life, and girl i tried and i tried
I feel like i can't walk, i feel like i can't talk girl i dont know what to do get back right with you i feel like i just
Walked outta heaven

The Rose,"Some say love, it is a river
that drowns the tender reed.
Some say love, it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger,
an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
and you its only seed.
It's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking
that never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
who cannot seem to give,
and the soul afraid of dyin'
that never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely
and the road has been to long,
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong,
just remember in the winter
far beneath the bitter snows
lies the seed that with the sun's love
in the spring becomes the rose.",Bette Midler

Love Will Never Do (Without You),"Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow
They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without
I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Has quite the same ooh ooh (ha ha ha!)
Like you do do do do babe
They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you",Janet Jackson 
Secret,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's
Chorus:
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn
If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for
(chorus)
I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,"I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you

I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
Well yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you
Loosed the chains
Carried the cross
Of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believed it

Without something there to remaind me 
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path

I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to 
It'll all get better in time
Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go 
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be 
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you

Africa,"I hear the drums echoing tonight

She's coming in 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stop to know that along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say,  Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serangetti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Maybe I was wrong for trying to pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

Because we belong together now
Forever united here somehow

Scars,"I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
Drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is
[Chorus:]
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand
[Chorus]
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
And I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand
Go fix yourself
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself

Bitch,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way
So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing
[Chorus]
Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me
[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way",Meredith Brooks

To know where my lucky love belongs,

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go

Are you strong enough to be my man
When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand

Once Bitten Twice Shy,"(Hunter)
Well the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels
You didn't know what rock-n-roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired you're lookin' kinda beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
You didn't know how rock-n-roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home from messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
You didn't know that rock-n-roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
I didn't know you had a rock-n-roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now it's dark and you're gone

Wind Beneath My Wings,"Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.
It must have been cold there in my shadow,
to never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.
You always walked a step behind.
So I was the one with all the glory,
while you were the one with all the strain.
A beautiful face without a name for so long.
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.
Did you ever know that you're my hero,
and everything I would like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings.
It might have appeared to go unnoticed,
but I've got it all here in my heart.
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.
I would be nothing without you.
Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I wish I could be.
I could fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings.
Did I ever tell you you're my hero
You're everything, everything I wish I could be.
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings,
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.
Oh, the wind beneath my wings.
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings.
Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.
Fly, fly, fly high against the sky,
so high I almost touch the sky.
Thank you, thank you,
thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.",Bette Midler 
What It's Like,"We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change 
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange 
He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes 
""Get a job you ****ing slob,"" is all he replies 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love 
He said, ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll 
I'm the man you've been dreaming of."" 
But 3 months later he say he won't date her or return her calls 
And she swear, ""God damn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls."" 
And then she heads for the clinic and 
she gets some static walking through the door 
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner 
and they call her a whore 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 
'cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose

I've seen a rich man beg 
I've seen a good man sin 
I've seen a tough man cry 
I've seen a loser win 
And a sad man grin 
I heard an honest man lie 
I've seen the good side of bad 
And the downside of up 
And everything between 
I licked the silver spoon 
Drank from the golden cup 
And smoked the finest green 
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times 
before I broke their heart 
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start 
I knew this kid named Max 
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs 
He liked to hang out late 
he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs 
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head 
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead 
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain 
You know it crumbles that way 
at least that's what they say when you play the game 
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose 
Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like...to have to lose",Everlast

Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws 
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors? 
How is murder? 
P. Diddy name me pretty 
Did it for the money, now can you get with me? 
People wanna know who is he, he get busy 
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy 
Niggas on the block know Mase motto 
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough 
98' Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe 
Case I'm every chased by a Donny Brascoe 
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here
[Mase] 
Yo, I can't get mad cuz you look at me 
Cuz on the real, look at me 
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear 
Dissin' every gear, but they better listen here 
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on yo own 
Cuz bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone 
Plus it won't be long till they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone 
Why you don't like me? 
Cuz I'm mad fly and icy? 
And why you can't satisfy yo wifey 
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure 
CD, TV's, really would I know ya 
Now me and blink float in the gold Rover 
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder 
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed 
Cuz Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it 
Why you over there lookin' at me

We was all at the Greek fest, it's hot and sandy 
I rent scooters,  I'm with my family 
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy 
But get approached by a girl named Tammy 
Who looked good enough to be Miss Miami 
But say, since some her peeps call her Candy 
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy 
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's 
He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties? 
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties? 
Please, tell me something that I don't know 
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10 
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends 
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie 
And please no hickies, cuz wifey's with me

If You Asked Me To,"Used to be that I believed in something

I could love someone 
I could trust someone 
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin' 
I said I'd never let nobody in 
But if you asked me to 
I just might change my mind 
And let you in my life forever 
If you asked me to 
I just might give my heart 
And stay here in your arms forever 
If you asked me to 
If you asked me to 
Somehow ever since I've been around you 
Can't go back to being on my own 
Can't help feeling darling since I've found you 
That I've found my home 
That I'm finally home 
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me darling 
I said I needed, needed to be free

Asked me to, I will give my world to you baby

Buffalo Stance,"Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocadile feet
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home. They all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?
Gigolo, Huh, sukka?
Gigolo. Gigolo, Huh, sukka?
Chorus 1:
Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me
Chorus 2:
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
Get funky. Yeah Timmy.
Tell it like it is. Check out this DJ.
So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place.
Chorus 1
Smokin.' Not cokin.' Get funky sax.
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch.
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance.
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass...rock this place!
What is he like? What's he like anway?
Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man
You know I mean?
Chorus 2 (twice)
Wind on my face, sound in my ears
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind
As I sink, diving down deep...deeper into your soul.

Father Figure,"That's all I wanted
Somthing special, something sacred -
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
Maybe this time is forever.....
Say it can be
That's all you wanted
Something special, something sacred -
In your life
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
But something tells me together
We'd be happy
(Baby)
I will be your father figure
(Oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher
(Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind
(It would make me)
I will be your father figure
(Very happy)
I have had enough of crime
(Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you -
Until the end of time
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyed shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
Until the end of time
If you are the desert
I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger -
Hunger for me
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be....
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby, baby
And love can't lie, no....
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always telling me so....
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
I won't let you go, my baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
(So I am gonna love you)
Until the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your preacher
I'll be your daddy
I will be the one who loves you until the end of time",George Michael 
Things Can Only Get Better,"We're not scared to lose it all
Security throw through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand sceptic hands
Won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize
And do you feel scared - I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Wow wow wow oh, wow wow wow oh oh oh oh
Treating today as though it was
The last, the final show
Get to sixty and feel no regret
It may take a little time 
A lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it
And do you feel
Wow wow wow oh...
And do you feel...",Howard Jones

Back For Good,"I guess now it's time for me to give up 
I feel it's time 
Got a picture of you beside me 
Got you're lipstick mark still on your coffee cup 
Got a fist of pure emotion 
Got a head of shattered dreams 
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now 
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it 
You'll be right and understood 
Unaware but underlined I figured out this story 
It wasn't good 
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory 
But that was not to be 
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free 
Can't you find a little room inside for me 
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it 
You'll be right and understood 
And we'll be together, this time is forever 
We'll be fighting and forever we will be 
So complete in our love 
We will never be uncovered again 
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
I just want you back for good 
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it 
You'll be right and understood",Take That 
Homeward Bound,"Homeward Bound
I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Silently for me.",Simon and Garfunkel 
Come Undone,"Mine immaculate dream made breath and skin I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo happy birthday to you was created for ya
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can't I belive you're taking my heart too pieces
Oh, it'll take a little time might take a little crime to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Words playing me deja-vu like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chills is it something real or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces
Lost in a snow filled sky we'll make it alright to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
(Can't ever keep from falling apart) Who do you need who do you love

November Rain,"When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this auch a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...
on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time...on my
own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...
on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever

It's Too Late,"Stayed in bed all mornin'
Just to pass the time
There's somethin' wrong here
There can be no denying
One of us is changin'
Or maybe we just stopped trying
And it's too late, baby,
Now it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...
It used to be so easy
Livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy
And I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy
And I feel like a fool
And it's too late, baby,
Now it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no...
There'll be good times again
For me and you,
But we just can't stay together
Can't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had
And how I once loved you,
But it's too late, baby,
Now it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it

Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own
Shouldn't get so hung up on you

I get so emotional, baby 
Every time I think of you 
I get so emotional, baby

I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

Last Night,"Last night you were so in to in
You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tatsted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
[Chorus:]
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun , the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
[Chorus]
Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love",AZ Yet 
Sexy Eyes,"(Allison Moorer/Doyle Primm)
Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day and learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind",Dr. Hook

Tell Her About It,"Listen boy
Don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away
You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made
She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do
Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means
Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure
Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe
Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone
Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means
Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait--you got to
Tell her about it",Billy Joel

It couldn't be no

Was captured for all to compare

Don't you dare
Get back into bed
Can't you see that it's late
No you can't have a drink

Catch of my breath what there is left of it.

Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others 
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that clost to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friends is true they'll be there with you 
Through the thick and thin

Yo is it me, is it me or can it be I am a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically

Just cause I am what some choose to envy

People say I asc a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah, yeah)

And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clique 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up

Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standin on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way
SHIT!!! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin at the light
[Chorus: Ron Browz]
How we ball in the club I know you hate it

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you she lyin but she fake it
When she with me she like it she never fake it

Still The Same,"Words and Music by Bob Seger 
You always won, everytime you placed a bet 
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet 
Everytime they were sure they had you caught 
You were quicker than they thought 
You'd just turn your back and walk 
You always said, the cards would never do you wrong 
The trick you said was never piay the game too long 
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take 
The only loss you could forsake 
The only bluff you couldn't fake 
And you're still the same 
I caught up with you yesterday 
Moving game to game 
No one standing in your way 
Turning on the charm 
Long enough to get you by 
You're still the same 
You still aim high 
There you stood, everybody watched you play 
I just turned and walked away 
I had nothing left to say 
'Cause you're still the same 
You're still the same 
Moving game to game 
Some thlngs never change",Bob Seger 
Fill Me In,"(All right)
(Come on)
(Can you fill me in)
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor
So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone
I'm not being mean
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say hey girl, come on right around
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride
Chucked in where nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down down down to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it coz you felt cold
I'm not being mean
I didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in
(Can you fill me in)
All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you
Baby
(Craig David)
Watching our every move
Think some day they might approve
Baby
Why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
(Can you fill me in)
Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on

Hero,"I am so high, I can hear heaven
I am so high, I can hear heaven
Whoa, but heaven...no, heaven don't hear me
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
Someone told me
Love would all save us
But, how can that be
Look what love gave us
A world full of killing
And blood spilling
That world never came
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It's in the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away

And they're watching us
They're watching us
As we all fly away",Chad Kroeger 
More Than A Feeling,"I looked out this morning and the sun was gone 
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky
It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped awa y. She slipped away. 
It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

Wait For You,"[Verse 1]
I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you 
& I'm wishing that you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone, 
Girl you could have stayed 
but you wouldnt give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more then i can stand
And all my tears they keep running down my face
Why did you turn away?
[Bridge]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me? 
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you wanted to be
[Chorus]
So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just aint true
I really need you in my life
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You got me feeling crazy (crazy)
How can you walk away,
Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby
What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is & it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me, your still in love with me
Don't leave me crying.
[Bridge]
Baby why can't we just start over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But your telling me it wont be enough
[Chorus]
So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just aint true
I really need you in my life
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you
[Bridge]
So why does you pride make you run & hide
Are you that afriad of me?
But I know it's a lie what your keeping inside
Thats not how you wanted to be
Baby I will wait for you
Baby I will wait for you
If it's the last thing i do
[Chorus]
Baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Don't Think I'm Not,"Don't Think I'm Not 
I don't have to question 
Where you were last night

I already know you'll lie 
But I can't be mad at ya

That when your gone I do my own thing 
Can I catch a bone? Why you dogging me? 
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not

Every Time I Close My Eyes,"Girl, it's been a long, long time comin'
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up it's gates for me and you
And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true
That someone like you
Loves me too

And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true

Sweet And Innocent,"You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
Out on to an open road you ride until the day
You learn to sleep at nigth with the price you pay
Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies
And in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death
Driving on through the night, unable to break away
From the restless pull of the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Now they'd come so far and they'd waited so long
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
Where the dark of night holds back the light of day
And you've gotta stand and fight for the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your hands
Do you remember the story of the promised land
How he crossed the desert sands
And could not enter the chosen land
On the banks of the river he stayed
To face the price you pay
So let the game start, you better run you little wild heart
You can run through all the nights and all the days
But just across the county line, a stranger passing through put up a sign
That counts the man fallen away to the price you pay, and girl before the end of
the day
I'm gonna tear it down and throw it away",Donny Osmond

We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love Is A Battlefield
We're losing control
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
Love Is A Battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love Is A Battlefield
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
Love Is A Battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing

When I'm Gone,"[Introduction]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going""
But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice
""Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""die Shady"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..
[Chorus/Outro]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Drops Of Jupiter,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated 
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way

Everybody Have Fun Tonight,"(Wang Chung / Peter Wolf)
I'd drive a million miles
To be with you tonight
So if you're feeling low
Turn up your radio
The words we use are strong
They make reality
But now the music's on
Oh baby dance with me
Rip it up - move down
Rip it up - move it down to the ground
Rip it up - cool down
Rip it up - and get the feeling not the word
Chorus:
Oh everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun
Deep in the world tonight
Our hearts beat safe and sound
I'll hold you so close
Just let yourself go down
Rip it up - move down
Rip it up - move it down to the ground
Rip it up - cool down
Rip it up - get the feeling not the wordRepeat Chorus
On the edge of oblivion
All the world is Babylon
And all the love and everyone
A ship of fools sailing on
Across the nation, around the world
Everybody have fun tonight
A celebration so spread the word

The Hardest Thing,"We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And baby it's killin' me, it's killin' you
Both of us tryin' to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love you
I know that we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Dr. Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending
And you will never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending
[Chorus]
Maybe another time, another day
As much as I want to, I can't stay
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

Another Sad Love Song,"Since you been gone

With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there U are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me

Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again

Only takes one note, I tell ya,

Where Does My Heart Beat Now,"So much to believe in - We were lost in time 
Everything I needed 
I feel in your eyes 
Always tought of keepin- 
Your heart next to mine 
But now that seems so far away 
Don't know how love could leave 
Without a trace 
Where do silent hearts go? 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Candle in the water - Drifting helplessly 
Hiding from the thunder- 
Come and rescue me 
Driven by hunger - 
Of the endless dream 
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold 
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know 
Where do silent hearts go? 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Then one touch overcomes the silence 
Love still survives 
Two hearts needing one another 
Give me wings to fly 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
I've got someone to give my heart to 
Feel it getting stronger and stronger 
And stronger 
And I feel inside 
Hearts are made to last 
Till the end of time",Celine Dion

No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin.

Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes 
And she's gone

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies 
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers 
That grow so incredibly high 
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore 
Waiting to take you away 
Climb in the back with you head in the clouds

Chariot,"Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon ohhhh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rised
It puts over me
[Chorus:]
Oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your:
Strength
Remember seeking moons rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
From bringing back
More than a memory

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup,
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Shake It Off,"[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off
By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me
[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

[Bridge]
I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...
I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know
[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciated all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me

Cause I see you try-na play me out 
But when the brother called the crib with beef 
Didn't I represent you? 
When I caught him in the streets 
So let me get the keys to Lex and then my checks

Love Bites,"If you've got love in your sights 
Watch out, love bites 
When you make love, do you look in the mirror 
Who do you think of, does he look like me 
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever 
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see 
Ooh babe ooh yeah 
When you're alone, do you let go 
Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show 
Ooh c'mon 
I don't wanna touch you too much baby 
'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy 
I know you think that love is the way you make it 
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it 
No! 
Love bites, love bleeds 
It's bringin' me to my knees 
Love lives, love dies 
It's no surprise 
Love begs, love pleads 
It's what I need 
When I'm with you are you somewhere else 
Am I gettin' thru or do you please yourself 
When you wake up will you walk out 
It can't be love if you throw it about

I Was Made To Love Her,"I was born in Lil' Rock,

We were always hand in hand.
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails,
Suzy was in pig tails,
I know I loved her even then.
You know my papa disapproved it,
My mama boohooed it,
But I told them time and time again,
""Don't you know I was made to love her,
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey.
She's been my inspiration,
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years.
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossmed tenderly,
My life grew sweeter through the years.
I know that my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
That's why we made it through the years.
I was made to love her,
Worship and adore her,
Hey, hey, hey.
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end,
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going nowhere.
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me,
I had the fever with each passing year.
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,
If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there.
'Cause I was made to love her,
I was made to live for her, yeah!

Built my world all around her,

Sexual Healing is something that's good for me
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're dealing
I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing
Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up, let's make love tonight
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 'cause you do it right
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual Healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's good to me
My baby ohhh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need Sexual Healing...",Marvin Gaye

Here I Go Again,"I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promices
In songs of yesterday
An' I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
But, here I go again
Here I go again
Tho' I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh, Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on
Cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
An' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
An' I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
An' I'm gonna hold on
For the rest of my days
Cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreamsAn' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
An' I've made up my mind

We Are The Champions,"We Are The Champions
Written by Freddie Mercury
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand
Kicked in my face
But I've come through
And we mean to go on and on and on and on
We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the World
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before
The whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go on and on and on and on
We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the World
We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers

The lengths that I will go to 
The distance in your eyes

That's me in the corner 
That's me in the spotlight

And I don't know if I can do it 
Oh no I've said too much 
I haven't said enough 
I thought that I heard you laughing 
I thought that I heard you sing 
I think I thought I saw you try 
Every whisper 
Of every waking hour I'm 
Choosing my confessions 
Trying to keep an eye on you 
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool 
Oh no I've said too much 
I set it up 
Consider this 
The hint of the century 
Consider this 
The slip that brought me 
To my knees failed 
What if all these fantasies 
Come flailing around 
Now I've said too much 
I thought that I heard you laughing 
I thought that I heard you sing 
I think I thought I saw you try 
But that was just a dream 
That was just a dream",R.E.M.

out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality
I never though love was meant for me
For Iwas blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the 
difference
Now love is so sincere

Two Hearts,"Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in

Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years. 
Donna Summer: 
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, 
no sigh of romance, 
We don't stand a chance. 
Barbra Streisand: 
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover 
But he turned out to be like every other man 
Our love, our love 
Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer: 
Raining (raining) 
Pouring (pouring) 
There's nothing left for us here 
And we won't waist another tear. 
Donna Summer: 
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, 
Don't you do it. 
Barbra Streisand: 
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, 
You can do it. 
Donna Summer: 
Tell him to just get out 
Barbra Streisand: 
Nothing left to talk about 
Donna Summer: 
Pack his raincoat, show him out 
Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer: 
Just look him in the eyes and simply shout... 
Enough is enough 
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more, no. 
Enough is enough 
I want him out, I want him out that door now 
Enough is enough 
Enough is enough 
That's enough 
Donna Summer: 
If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right when it's over 
Barbra Streisand: 
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, 
Get it over 
Donna Summer: 
(over, over) 
Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer: 
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, 
Spell it out... 
Enough is enough is enough, 
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more, no. 
Enough is enough is enough 
I want him out, I want him out that door now. 
Enough is enough 
Enough is enough 
That's enough 
Barbra Streisand: 
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover, 
But he turns out to be like every other man. 
Our love (I had no choice from the start) 
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart) 
Our love (Tearing us apart) 
Enough is enough is enough 
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more, no. 
Enough is enough is enough 
I want him out, I want him out that door now. 
Enough is enough 
Enough is enough 
That's enough 
Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer: 
No more tears (No more tears) 
No more tears (No more tears) 
No more tears (No more tears) 
No more tears (No more tears) 
Enough is enough is enough is enough 
Is enough is enough... 
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, 
We've had it 
Donna Summer: 
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover 
Barbra Streisand: 
But he turned out to be like every other man 
Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer: 
I had no choice from the start 
I've gotta listen to my heart 
Tearing us apart 
Enough is enough is enough 
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more, no. 
Enough is enough is enough 
I want him out, I want him out that door now 
Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister 
Goodbye sugar 
It's raining, it's pouring, 
There's nothing left for us here 
And we won't waist another tear 
No more tears 
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough 
Is enough is enough is enough!",Barbra Streisand 
In My Bed,"[Jermaine Dupri]
You wanna dance
Ha, I'ma make you dance
You wanna move
Ha, I'ma make you move
Dru Hill come on
[Dru Hill]
I got this feeling
I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around
Like I was your fool
Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me bout things going on
But deep in my heart babe
I hope that I'm wrong
[Chorus]
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed)
Sleepin' in bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Takin my place, Oh oh)
I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face
(Written on your face)
Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door
But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me things are still the same
Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name
[Chorus]
What else did you want
What else did you need
Giving you everything plus my heart
I gave you the world (Yes I did)
Cause you were my girl (Oh yes I)
But you still ran out on me
[Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, fly shit, differnt colors whips
I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips
Got too many
[Da Brat]
My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family
[Jermaine Dupri]
Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs
And now I keep it commin' stong till the early morn
[Da Brat]
Lemme interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit
[Jermaine Dupri]
I make em sick cause I'm the williest
[Da Brat]
Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch
[Jermaine Durpi]
Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal
[Da Brat]
Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers
[Jermaine Dupri]
We make believers out of dreamers

Missing,"I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And pass your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were
Two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind
While you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you
Shout down to me
Where I always used to be
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train
I ask
Why did I come again?
Can I confess
I've been hanging'round
Your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing
Since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on
And I miss you-
Like the deserts miss the rain",Everything But The Girl

Union's been on strike 
He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough 
Gina works the diner all day 
Working for her man, she brings home her pay 
For love - for love 
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got

If we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot 
For love - we'll give it a shot

Whooah,  we're half way there 
Livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear 
Livin' on a prayer 
Tommy's got his six string in hock 
Now he's holding in what he used 
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough 
Gina dreams of running away 
When she cries in the night 
Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday 
We've got to hold on to what we've got 
'Cause it doesn't make a difference 
If we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot 
For love - we'll give it a shot
