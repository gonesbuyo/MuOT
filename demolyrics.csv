Smooth,"(feat. Rob Thomas)
Man it's a hot one 
Like seven inches from the midday sun 
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone 
But you stay so cool 
My munequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa 
Your my reason for reason 
The step in my groove 
And if you say this life ain't good enough 
I would give my world to lift you up 
I could change my life to better suit your mood 
Cause you're so smooth 
And just like the ocean under the moon 
Well that's the same emotion that I get from you 
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth 
Gimme your heart, make it real 
Or else forget about it 
I'll tell you one thing 
If you would leave it would be a crying shame 
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out 
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio 
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow 
Turning you round and round",Santana 
You Light Up My Life,"So many nights I sit by my window 
Waiting for someone to sing me his song 
So many dreams I kept deep inside me 
Alone in the dark but now 
You've come along 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water 
Could it be finally I'm turning for home? 
Finally, a chance to say hey, 
I love You 
Never again to be all alone 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
You light up my life 
You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
It can't be wrong 
When it feels so right 
'Cause You 
You light up my life",Debby Boone 
How Do I Live,"How do I get through the night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh I need you in my arms need you to hold
You are my world my heart my soul
If you ever leave baby you would take away
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live
Without you
There would be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my live
There would be no wonder for me
And I baby I don't know what I would do
I've be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave baby you would take away
Everything real in my life and tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live
Please tell me baby how do I go on
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything need you with me
Baby don't you know that you are
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live
How do I live without you
How do I live without you baby
How do I live without you",LeAnn Rimes
