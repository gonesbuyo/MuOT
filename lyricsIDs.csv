Ce1r05SSbwA,Smooth,"(feat. Rob Thomas)
Man it's a hot one 
Like seven inches from the midday sun 
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone 
But you stay so cool 
My munequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa 
Your my reason for reason 
The step in my groove 
And if you say this life ain't good enough 
I would give my world to lift you up 
I could change my life to better suit your mood 
Cause you're so smooth 
And just like the ocean under the moon 
Well that's the same emotion that I get from you 
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth 
Gimme your heart, make it real 
Or else forget about it 
I'll tell you one thing 
If you would leave it would be a crying shame 
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out 
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio 
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow 
Turning you round and round",Santana 
Ps-mZ5BQQDY,How You Remind Me,"Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
for handing you a heart worth breaking
and I've been wrong, i've been down,
to the bottom of every bottle
these five words in my head
scream ""are we having fun yet""
yet, yet, yet, no, no
yet, yet, yet, no, no
it's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
And this is how, you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how, you remind me
Of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
for handing you a heart worth breaking

Of what i really am

cd8xLlZJr7I,Gloria,"Gloria, you're always on the run now
Running after somebody, you gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown, so be careful not to show it
You really don't remember, was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?
Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you, why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line, oh-oh-oh, calling Gloria
Gloria (Gloria), I think they got your number (Gloria)
I think they got the alias (Gloria) that you've been living under (Gloria)
But you really don't remember, was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?
A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, Gloria, how's it gonna go down?
Will you meet him on the main line, or will you catch him on the rebound?
Will you marry for the money, take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away, don't believe it's comin' back soon
And you really don't remember, was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

6BtI43kqkOI,Firework,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under?
Scream but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe you reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh""

kJZvFSqGVYQ,Look Away,"When you called me up this morning, 
told me 'bout the new love you found, 
I'm said "";I'm happy for you, 
I'm really happy for you.""; 
Found someone else, 
I guess I won't be coming 'round. 
I guess it's over, baby; 
it's really over, baby, whoa... 
And from what you said 
I know you've gotten over me; 
it'll never be the way it used to be. 
So if it's gotta be this way, 
don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay. 
But if you see me walking by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way. 
When we both agreed as lovers, 
we were better off as friends, 
that's how it had to be, 
yeah, that's how it had to be. 
I tell you I'm fine 
but sometimes I just pretend; 
wish you were holding me, 
wish you were still holding me, whoa... 
I just never thought, 
that I would be replaced so soon; 
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you. 
I know I wanted to be free; 
yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be. 
But if you see me waling by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday,

look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way.

oGV6yhY6M90,Philadelphia Freedom,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 
I used to be a rolling stone 
You know if the cause was right 
I'd leave to find the answer on the road 
I used to be a heart beating for someone 
But the times have changed 
The less I say the more my work gets done 
`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom 
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag 
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man 
Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had 
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you 
Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind 
Shine a light shine a light 
Shine a light won't you shine a light 
Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do 
If you choose to you can live your life alone 
Some people choose the city 
Some others choose the good old family home 
I like living easy without family ties 
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me 
Right between the eyes",Elton John 
doJbORheLzw,Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Gotye:]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[Kimbra:]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
[Gotye:]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough
And you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

HBG3hBBiYLk,Waterfalls,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam
She'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping
At all 'cause he can't seem to keep
His self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and lakes that
You're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way
Or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is baby it's good to me
One day he goes and takes a glimpse
In the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
3 letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
[Chorus]
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin' prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

8YlnhtXo0Tk,I Will Survive,"At first I was afraid I was petrified

I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}
If you wanna role in my Mercedes {Yeah!}
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups, 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that  quot;hard quot; role 
And tell you that the butt ain't go
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waste is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

I didn't need the pain 
Once or twice was enough 
And it was all in vain 
Time starts to pass 
Before you know it you're frozen 
But something happened 
For the very first time with you 
My heart melts into the ground 
Found something true 
And everyone's looking round 
Thinking I'm going crazy 
But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 
Trying hard not to hear 
But they talk so loud 
Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
Try to fill me with doubt 
Yet I know that the goal 
Is to keep me from falling 
But nothing's greater 
Than the rush that comes with your embrace 
And in this world of loneliness 
I see your face 
Yet everyone around me 
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe 
But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Is he No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo

He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go

This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product

But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama's screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another jam or not 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got

Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that
special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me
of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear 
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears 
You really had me going, wishing on a star 
But the black holes that surround you are heavies by far 
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn 
Well it must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born 
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide 
You really can't be serious if you have to ask me why 
I say goodbye... 
'Cause I am barely breathing, And I can't find the air 
I don't know who I'm kidding, imaging you care 
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day 
But I don't suppose it's worth the price, worth the price 
The price that I would play 
Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? 
I used to be so certain, and I can't figure out 
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain 
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame 
Will it ever change?

No libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring

Z-yLH5wcEoQ,Run-Around,"Music & Lyrics: John Popper
Once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down 
And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme so don't you feed me a line 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down 
Tra la la la la bombardier this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
My cup shall always be full 
Oh I like coffee
And I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay
So be that way
I hope and pray
That there's something left to say 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down 
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down",Blues Traveler

Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABC's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees

When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the sping is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons have all gone
Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the familiy
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them I'll be there
We had joy, we had fun...
Goodbye, Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye, Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

X8K0mUagwPw,How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do.
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow.
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow, noone said a word about the sorrow.
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.",Bee Gees 
RmNTAvnSais,Bad Day,"Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day

You're coming back down and you really don't mind

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong
So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride

But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all

You played it
You played it

Walking fast
Faces passed
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making my way

And I miss you
And now I wonder....
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever 
Think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your
Precious memories
'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder....

And now I wonder....
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you...
If I could fall
Into the sky

Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
If I could 
Just hold you

Police have got the choke hold, oh then we just lost the beat

Out on another gorgeous sunny Saturday, not seein' that bumper to bumper traffic)

Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
You called out to our country 
And you whispered to those in pain 
Now you belong to heaven 
And the stars spell out your name 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will 
Loveliness we've lost 
These empty days without your smile 
This torch we'll always carry 
For our nation's golden child 
And even though we try 
The truth brings us to tears 
All our words cannot express 
The joy you brought us through the years 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned our long before 
Your legend ever will 
Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
Goodbye England's rose 
From a country lost without your soul 
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion 
More than you'll ever know 
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And you footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will",Elton John

Teach them well and let them lead the way

Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I fall in love whenever we meet 
I'm asking you what you know about these things 
How will I know if he's thinking of me 
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)

This love is strong why do I feel weak

I wanna look into the windows of your soul...again, again
Who's to know where time will lead us now?
I can't believe this is happening now
I'm not scared, I'm just wondering how
I wanna see your eyes
All the time we've shared between us now
The feeling I have needs me to make a vow
Now as I leave I must return somehow
Cause I wanna see your eyes
When I look at you I fumble, my confidence takes a tumble
But when I look into your eyes, I just crumble
'Cos I know that it's you that my heart burns for
That it's you that I'm yearning for

Waiting for someone to sing me his song 
So many dreams I kept deep inside me

You've come along

You give me hope 
To carry on 
You light up my days 
and fill my nights with song 
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water 
Could it be finally I'm turning for home? 
Finally, a chance to say hey, 
I love You 
Never again to be all alone

To carry on 
You light up my days

Little mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was zoned in sexy woman
Let me show it make me want it
Two in the morning I'm zoned in

Made it drop

Walkin' home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you 
Went our separate ways

Like a million miles away from me you Couldn't see how I adored ya 
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights 
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame 
I worked my fingers to the bone 
Made myself a name 
Funny I seemed to find 
That no matter how the years unwind 
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss 
And the love I left behind

Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday.
Brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up. Turn the sheets down.
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hot into bed

This lovely black butterfly 
Must take a chance, and spread my wings

She comes round and she goes down on me 
And I make her smile, like a drug for you 
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you 
Keep on smiling, what we go through 
One stop to the rhythm that divides you 
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse 
Chop another line like a coda with a curse 
Come on like a freak show takes the stage 
We give them the games we play, she said... 
I want something else, to get me through this 
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby 
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye 
The sky was gold, it was rose 
I was taking sips of it through my nose 
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there 
Smiling in the pictures you would take 
Doing crystal myth, will lift you up until you break 
It won't stop, I won't come down 
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop 
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given 
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again 
I said... 
How do I get back there, to the place where I fell asleep inside you 
How do I get myself back to the place where you said... 
I want something else, to get me through this 
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby 
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye 
I believe in the sand beneath my toes 
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling 
I believe in the faith that grows 
And the four right chords can make me cry 
When I'm with you I feel like I could die 
And that would be all right, all right 
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing 
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive 
Now I'm struggling to survive, those days you were wearing that velvet dress 
You're the priestess, I must confess 
Those little red panties they pass the test 
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress 
One 
And you hold me, and we're broken 
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now 
Feel myself, head made of the ground 
I'm scared, I'm not coming down 
No, no 
And I won't run for my life 
She's got her jaws now, locked down in a smile 
But nothing is all right, all right 
And I want something else, to get me through this life 
Baby, I want something else 
Not listening when you say... 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye 
Good-bye

I was taking sips of it through my nose

You're becoming a dream to me
Fairytale fantasy

A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there
It's something we both share
Because
[Chorus - Chris Brown]
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl it's getting late you can stay the night
But you can dipout anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh

So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more (ah.. ready?)
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever

Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular
And then I get back to ya
With diamond like precision
Insatiable is what I envision

TAyhnyrbCKw,Waiting On The World To Change,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting

If you'll be my girl

She's so pretty
Lord, she's fine

_DChlfgcDJk,Hero,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
[Chorus:]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
[Chorus]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

I wonder how it's going to be

Doorway we spent time in, swings empty 
Don't see lightning like last fall

When it goes down 
How's it going to be 
When you're not around 
How's it going to be 
When you found out there was nothing 
Between you and me 
Cause I don't care 
How's it going to be 
And how's it going to be 
When you don't know me anymore 
And how's it going to be

EaUWPE1GGr8,Crocodile Rock,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
when Suzie wore her dresses tight
and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last",Elton John

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better
Reason to write you a love song today
Promise me that you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone
'cause I believe there's a way you can love me
Because I say
I won't write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
Is that why you wanted a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

There's a reason to
Write you a love song today",Sara Bareilles

You like the movies 
And I like T.V. 
I take things serious 
And you take 'em light

And I party all night

It just all works out

I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract

And he steals the covers 
She likes it neat 
And he makes a mess 
I take it easy 
Baby I get obsessed 
She's got the money 
And he's always broke

And I like to smoke

Just ain't a one

Get our differences patched 
Don't really matter

nHuko5BCFzA,Strangers In The Night,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through.
Something in your eyes was so inviting,
Something in your smile was so exciting,
Something in my heart,
Told me I must have you.
Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello.
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away,
A warm embracing dance away and -
Ever since that night we've been together.
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
It turned out so right,
For strangers in the night.",Frank Sinatra

I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt

She so-so-sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all (she) do is (bang)!

Send them your heart, so they'll know that someone cares 
And their lives will be stronger and free

I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
Cut up, Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes

""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""

I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray

If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
I don't think so. She's looking at me.""

Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can 
Cause your girls real wild throw your hands up high 
Wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy 
You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly 
Friend so fly I can go fly 
Private, cause I handle mine

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny 
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try 
You don't come, I ain't gonna die 
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it with an ace so high 
Baby, you decide that I ain't your guy 
Ain't gon lie ,Me in your space 
But forget your face, I swear I will 
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill 
Just bring wit me a pair, I will

Walking on the beach our toes in the sand

How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

rXVHdeTuNH8,Touch Me In The Morning,"(Ron Miller/Michael Masser) 
Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
(Hey!)
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before
(Hey!)
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
Then just walk away
(We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow,
(There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday
(But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
Touch me in the morning...",Diana Ross 
pG8g0TzYqLo,Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,"Sweet:
Why'd you run away
Don't you like my style?
Why dont you come and play
I guarantee a great big smile
I come from the imagination
And I'm here by your invocation
So what'd you say
Why don't we dance a while
I'm the heart of swing
I'm the twist and shout
When you gotta sing
When you gotta let it out
You call me and i come a-runnin'
I turn the music on - I bring the fun in
No we're parying - that's what it's all about
'cause I know what you feel, girl
I Know just what you feel, girl
All these melodies
They go no too long
then that enery
Starts to come on way too strong
All those hearts laid open - that must sing
Plus some customers just start combusting
That's the penalty
When life us but a song
You brought me down and doomed this town
So when we blow this scene
Back we will go to my kingdom below
And you will be my queen
'Cause I know what you feel girl
Dawn:
No you see
You and me
Wouldn't be very regal
Sweet:
And i make it real, girl
Dawn:
What i mean
I'm Fifteen
So this  queen  thing's illegal
Sweet:
I cn bring whole citites to ruin
And still have time to get a soft shoe in
Dawn:
No that's great
But I'm late
And I'd hate to delay her
Sweet:
Somthing's cooking - I'm at the griddle
I bought nero his very first fiddle
Dawn:
She'll get pissed
If I'm missed
See, my sister's the Slayer
Sweet:
Now we're partying
Thats what it's all about",Crystal Gayle 
DmBSGlXqC4Q,I Hope You Dance,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
GOD forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin',
Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter,
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(what)
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

No diggity, I try to bag it up, bag it up

Curve's the words, spin's the verbs 
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rolin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way

Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time

I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
There're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still, instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son
They're gone
The sun shines bright
And anger rises
Lorn and lonely
Torn apart
Don't you think
It's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray
That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise
So let's pray
And blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying
Crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
That's what minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense
Outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore",Daryl Hall & John Oates

Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent

Surreal you're your ribcage menagerie
Listen to lips that lull you to sleep beside
A living nightmare
In front of a fake friend fell on your knees
His death in a car crash cured your disease
Still in the water food for the fishes
Would anyone miss him?
With his words like mercury
Filling the holes from razor gazes
A verbal gauze for broken hearts
Seal the coffin careless to kiss
Stab at the angels that gave you to me
Morbid my love lives forever inside my chest
She completes me
I stare at the sky through a blanket of filth
Means to an end their exhaust in my lungs
Stinging my eyes like a tear for an unborn child
But she stares with me

And carve your name into my heart

Stay away, don't you invade my home.

I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay.

There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health.

Here they come, those feelings again!

Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine
The sailors say ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""

Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

And Brandy does her best to understand

Remember life holds for you one guarantee

If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch you so tenderly

In the courtyard birds were singing your praise 
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel 
Alright I carried them with me today now

This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 
I wonder why 
I feel so high though I am not above the sorrow 
Heavy hearted 'till you call my name 
And it sounds like church bells or the whistle of a train 
On a summer evening I'll run to meet you barefoot 
Barely breathing 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy (oh darling) 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 
It's not too near for me 
Like a flower I need the rain 
Though it's not clear to me 
Every season has its change 
And I will see you 
When the sun comes out again 
As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name

Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,
Kids clappin' love to spark the place,
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face,
It's a cold world, and this is ice,
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.
Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave.
10 years been legit they still figure me bad.
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit.
Should've been called armed robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny...
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit.
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.

With a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies.
Listen we don't pay admission,
And bouncers don't check us,
And we walk around the metal detectors.
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor,
Reckless, check it, said it?!
Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed 
now we 'bout to change the game nigga.

Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,

Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

Now we livin' better now, 
Gucci sweater now,
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now,
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's.
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit,
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.

If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up.
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker,
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this,
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.

That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts inste-ad, ""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts inste-ad.""
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""

I came to win
Battle me that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up
Punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up, come on!
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling jump across the ceiling
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk
Yo, I'll bust em in the eye
And then I'll take the punks home
Feel it, funk it
Amps it are junking
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunking
Donuts shop
Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill
Plus my mom and my pops

Jump around [3x]
Jump up Jump up and get down
Jump [18x]
I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle bring a shotgun
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Try and step to me you'll take your last breath
I gots the skill, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot ta give, I shoot to kill

Listen to the sound that pounds, I jump around
I'm no clown, I get down
To the funk, listen to the wig out
And step to the rear, dear, cause I'm here
The P to the E to the T E rockin'
The runs in your stockin'
So hon, put the lock in
Chillin' with the House Of Pain
Blood stains the ground
Huh, I jump around
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try'n to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics homie I'll wet ya

2naehMUQpQY,A Horse With No Name,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There was sand and hills and rings 
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz 
And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la ... 
After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la ... 
After nine days I let the horse run free 
'Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
there was sand and hills and rings 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And a perfect disguise above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

opPV1-IUmGw,Viva La Vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Or if He really does exist
Why did He desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that there are more hearts
broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?
Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

Shout
Let it all out
These are things I can do without
Come On
I'm talking to you
Come on
In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
Shout
They gave you life
And in return you gave them them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
Shout
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart

u0itzW8Siqg,Half-Breed,"My father married a pure Cherokee 
My mother's people were ashamed of me 
The Indians said I was white by law 
The white man always called me  Indian Squaw  
CHORUS:
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard 
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word 
Half-breed, she's no good they warned 
Both sides were against me since the day I was born 
We never settled, went from town to town 
When you're not welcome you don't hang around 
The other children always laughed at me 
 Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee  
Chorus
We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed 
Nineteen I left them, tell me who's to blame 
My life since then has been from man to man 
But I can't run away from what I am

5-Bq5uqpLmE,In The End,"(It starts with)
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",Linkin Park

You could be my someone
you could be my scene

But the words come out to rough 
I know you were tryin' 
to give me the best of your love 
Beautiful faces and loud, empty places 
Look at the way that we live 
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine 
Left us so little to give 
That same old crowd 
Was like a cold dark cloud 
That we could never rise above 
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love 
Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love, oh 
Sweet darlin', you get the best of my love 
I'm goin' back in time 
And it's a sweet dream 
It was a quiet night 
And I would be all right 
If i could go on sleepin' 
But every mornin' 
I wake up and worry 
What's gonna happen today 
You see it your way 
And I see it mine 
But we both see it slippin' away 
You know we always had each other baby 
I guess that wasn't enough 
Oh, but here in my heart 
I give you the best of my love

ZqtyQuXo9zM,Tears In Heaven,"by Eric Clapton and Will Jennings
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on,
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day,
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure,
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.
First Verse",Eric Clapton

""Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?""
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
""Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of while wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that they're out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight `A' student?
""If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.""

Nothing means more to me than what we share
No one in this whole world can ever compare
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind
Angel of Mine
What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life sent from above (Sent from above)
When I lost all hope, you showed me love (Boy you showerd me love)
I'm checkin' for ya, boy you're right on time (Right on Time)
Angel of Mine (Angel of mine)
I never knew I could feel each moment
As if it were new,
Every breath that I take, the love that we make
I only share it with you (you, you, you,you)
When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of Mine
You came into my life sent from above (Came into my life, yeah yeah yeah)
When I lost all hope you showed me love (Boy You showed me love, uh huh)
I'm shakin' for ya, boy you're right on time (But boy your right on time)
Angel of Mine (Angel of mine, oh mine)
How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow
I look at you lookin' at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm checkin' for ya, boy you're right on time

7OT7iFtE1Ak,Every Rose Has Its Thorn,"We both lie silently still 
in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Chorus:
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does
I listen to our favorite song 
playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and 
easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now 
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess
Chorus
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains
Solo
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways
But now I hear you found somebody new
and that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess",Poison

HFStDIxOX1s,One Headlight,"So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees
I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste
She always had a pretty face
So I wondered how she hung around this place
Hey, come on try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than 
In the middle
But me & Cinderella
We put it all together We can drive it home
With one headlight
She said it's cold
It feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sign up ahead
At the county line bridge
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothin' left
She hit the end it's just her window ledge
Hey, come on try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than 
In the middle
But me & Cinderella
We put it all together We can drive it home
With one headlight
Well this place is old
It feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
I think of death it must be killin' me
Hey, come on try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than 
In the middle
But me & Cinderella
We put it all together We can drive it home

And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

I'll put his picture down and maybe

[Verse - Usher] (w/ Lil Jon in background) 
Up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I 
Keep it down on the low key (low key) 
You should know how it feels (hey!! hey!!) 
I seen shorty she was checking up on me 
From the game she was spitting in my ear 
You would think that she knew me (knew me) 
I decided to cheat (okay!!) Conversation got heavy! (hey!) 
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow! (watch out!!) 
Oh! (watch out!!) She's saying ""come get me!"" (come get me) 
So I got up and followed her to the floor 
She said ""baby let's go"" 
When I told her (let's go!!) I said 
[Chorus - Usher & (Lil Jon)]

She's all up in my head now 
Got me thinking that it might 
Be a good idea to take her with me 
Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leeeeaaavvee) (let's go!!) 
And I got to keep it real now 
Cause on a 1 to 10, she's a certified 20 
But that's just ain't me (hey!!) 
Cause I don't - know, if I take that chance 
She swears he's gonna leave 
But what I do - know, is the way she dance 
Make shorty alright with me

Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous 
In the club looking so conspicuous 
And RAWR!! These women all on the prowl 
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow 
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth! 
I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!! 
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes 
Then ""bend over to the front! and touch your toes!!"" 
I - left the Jag I took the Rolls 
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrollll (oww!!)

When my pinky's baguette over three hundred thou-sand! 
Let's drink, you the one to please

We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say.

Did you even care about my piece of mind
I find that in the end, you're just a big old..
I can't seem to recall why you keep on laughing
At your stupid jokes, they're a waste of your time
Cause I find that in the end, you're just a big old bore
And I never wanted more than just a little fun

Has you by the throat and has you running blind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to believe how you keep on clutching
With all your might to your nickels and dimes
I find that in the end you're just a big old bore
And I never wanted more than just a little fun
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
I don't wanna behave
And I don't wanna live up to your standards
I'd always thought that we had the same goals
But now I know what you're after
You'll do anything to get what you want
And there's nothing that I wouldn't put past you
It's pathetic to see how uptight you can be
When things don't all go your way
I can't seem to remember when you first began to start this shit
And tried to mess with my mind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to recall why years have gone by and you're still the same
You stay trailing behind and I find that in the end
You know you're a big old bore

With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out

LLPj2h0N3bU,From A Distance,"From a distance the world looks blue and green,
and the snow-capped mountains white.
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,
and the eagle takes to flight.
From a distance, there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
it's the voice of every man.
From a distance we all have enough,
and no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
no hungry mouths to feed.
From a distance we are instruments
marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.
God is watching us. God is watching us.
God is watching us from a distance.
From a distance you look like my friend,
even though we are at war.
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
what all this fighting is for.
From a distance there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
it's the heart of every man.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves.
This is the song of every man.
And God is watching us, God is watching us,
God is watching us from a distance.
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching.
God is watching us from a distance.",Bette Midler 
5ZYgIrqELFw,All Star,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
[Chorus:]
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
[Repeat Chorus 2x]
Somebody once asked could you spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

I was confused you cleared my mind 
I sold my soul you bought it back for me 
And held me up and gave me dignity 
Somehow you needed me 
You gave me strength to stand alone again 
To face the world out on my own again 
You put me high upon a pedestal 
So high that I could almost see eternity 
You needed me, you needed me 
And I can't believe it's you 
I can't believe it's true 
I needed you and you were there 
And I'll never leave why should I leave? 
I'd be a fool 
Cause, I finally found someone who really cares 
You held my hand when it was cold 
When I was lost you took me home 
You gave me hope when I was at the end 
and turned my lies back into truth again 
You even called me friend 
You gave me strength to stand alone again 
To face the world out on my own again 
You put me high upon a pedestal

RZYpzXjdtwg,The Sounds Of Silence,"The Sound of Silence
Hello darkness, my old friend, 
I've come to talk with you again, 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping, 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence. 
In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence. 
And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more. 
People talking without speaking, 
People hearing without listening, 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare 
Disturb the sound of silence. 
 Fools  said I,  You do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows. 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
Take my arms that I might reach you.  
But my words like silent raindrops fell, 
And echoed 
In the wells of silence 
And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made. 
And the sign flashed out its warning, 
In the words that it was forming. 
And the sign said,  The words of the prophets 
are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls.  
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Simon and Garfunkel

    It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
    And you'll see that it's time to move on
    I won't do that! No I won't do that!
     I know the territory, I've been around
    It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
    And sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
    I won't do that! No I won't do that!

    I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that",Meat Loaf

[Ashanti (Ja talking)]
Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby
[Chorus - Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
[Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care
[Chorus]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care
[Chorus]
Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care
[Chorus]
[Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine

With a bit of rock music, everything is fine

And when you get the chance...
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen

Leave them burning and then you're gone

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.
Thought that she was the one for me,
Til I found out she was on her dream,
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.
This is why we could never be.

See her face whenever I, I look at you.

But I'd be lingering the rest to you,
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got their money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh whey oh)

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh whey oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more.

All the kids in the market place say:
Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian.
Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard, you know (oh whey oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac.
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh whey oh)
Spin the clubs, cruise down the block.
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh whey oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian.
All the cops in the donut shop say:
Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian.",Bangles 
61HRdUcJtXQ,No Air,"Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air
Oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
If there was a way that I can make you understand
But how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
[Chorus] 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air
No air, air
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care
But how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
[Chorus] 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air
No air, air
No more
It's no air, no air

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

CTTjLxXFg0k,Because Of You,"I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you",Kelly Clarkson

Uh, uh, uh, huh

Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin
Expressway, hair back, weavin through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all aint writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you aint gizell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I aint goin nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You aint a ganster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me
Now while you grittin your teeth
Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take alot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Aint no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I aint scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes
[CHORUS]

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out

It's the M.I.B.'s, uhh, here come the M.I.B.'s
	Here come the Men in Black
	They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me -- M.I.B.
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there
is now gone, black suit with the black Ray Ban's on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no figerprints
Saw somethin strange, watch your back 
Cause you never quite know where the M.I.B.'s is at
Uh and...
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	Galaxy defenders (oahhaooohh ohhhhh)
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	They won't let you remember
Uh uh, uh uh, now
from the deepest of the darkest of night
on the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no M.I.B.'s, can I please
do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean  I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
M.I.B.'s, freezin up all the flack
(What's that stand for) Men In Black
Uhh M
	The Men in Black...
	The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me
Just slide with me c'mon 
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me 
Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze...
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	The galaxy defenders
Right on, right on
	Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
	They won't let you rememberk (ohhhh nooooo)
Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin
I know we might seem imposin
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
Cause we see things that you need not see 
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, cause that's the Men in

m8jDXfybjco,The River Of Dreams,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
>From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross
And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Though the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night",Billy Joel

the taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl just to try it,
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
It felt so wrong,
it felt so right.
Don't mean I'm in love tonight.
I kissed a girl and I liked it (I liked it).
No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter.
You're my experimental game, just human nature.
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused, hard to obey.

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable.
Hard to resist, so touchable.
Too good to deny it.

On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you

You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

Is to let all our worries

There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me.
I know you've got somewhere to go,
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave.
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon.
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.
The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above.
Underneath the velvet skies,
Love is all that matters. Won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave.

I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily.
So don't you go and say goodbye,
You can lay your worries down and stay with me.
And don't you ever leave.

That don't really matter to anyone, anymore 
But like a fool I keep losing my place 
And I keep seeing you walk through that door 
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much 
And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust 
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are 
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough 
Now I could never change you 
I don't wanna blame you 
Baby you don't have to take the fall 
Yes I may have hurt you

Maybe I just want to have it all

Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone 
I touch the right spot at the right time 
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind 
So seductive, you should see the way she winds

To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say,
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you.

Dealing with feelings I  don't wanna hide
Learning to love as I go, baby

Tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell
Girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care.

'Cause you know
That all  I really (all I really) want is you.
Sorry if you felt misled
But I know what I feel, I know what I said, baby
God I hope you believe, believe in all that we can be
The future in us together in love.
You're the reason I'm strong
Don't you think I don't know
This is where I belong
Give me the time
To say that you're mine, to say that you're mine.

You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on, holding on to time
So now we're living separate lives
Well I have learned to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, you never let it show, oh no
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living - now we're living - separate lives
Ooh, it's so difficult, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall - you build that wall
Yes you build that wall - oh yes, you build that wall
And you make it stronger - no
You have no right to ask me how I feel - oh no
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might - I just might - find myself looking in your eyes

Thinking of you till it hurts

For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long, lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too? 
does the feeling seem oh, so right? 
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on? 
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day

What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby
[CHORUS]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find
[CHORUS]
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that

U0EW0s1fN-8,Crazy,"I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that phase. 
Even your emotions had an echo 
In so much space 
And when you're out there 
Without care, 
Yeah, I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Probably 
And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
But think twice, that's my only advice 
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are, 
Ha ha ha bless your soul 
You really think you're in control 
Well, I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb 
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them 
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun 
And it's no coincidence I've come 
And I can die when I'm done 
Maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy 
Probably",Gnarls Barkley

if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting

turned to gray 
watching through windows--you're wondering

the drum beats out of time-- 
if you're lost you can look--and you will find me

That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me

All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love

W5razGLu9gA,Slow Hand,"As the midnight moon was drifting through 
The lazy sway of the trees 
I saw the look in your eyes lookin' into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin' don't say a word cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine 
I'm tired of fast moves 
I've got a slow groove 
On my mind 
I want a man with a slow hand 
I want a lover with an easy touch 
I want somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I want somebody who will understand 
When it comes to love I want a slow hand 
On shadowed ground with no one around 
And a blanket of stars in our eyes 
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves 
On the crazy wind of the night 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine 
If I want it all night 
You say it's alright 
We got the time 
'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I found somebody who will understand 
When it comes to love I want a slow hand 
If I want it all night 
Please say it's alright 
It's not a fast move 
But a slow groove 
On my mind 
'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I found somebody who will understand

You can tell my feet to hit the floor

You can tell your dog to bite my leg

Another night slowly closes in, 
And I feel so lonely.
Touching heat freezing on my skin, 
I pretend you still hold me.
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep.
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you.
I can't believe you're gone.
You were the first, you'll be the last.
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon. 
Remember: after the fire, after all the rain, 
I will be the flame. 
I will be the flame.
Watching shadows move across the wall, 
I feel so frightened.
I wanna run to you, I wanna call, 
But I've been hit by lightening.
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart.
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you.
You'll always be the one.
You were the first, you'll be the last.
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon. 
Remember: after the fire, after all the rain, 
I will be the flame.

Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better baby

7mJXhEeWhI4,Photograph,"Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times
I wonder if It's too late
Should i go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh oh oh
Oh god I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh god I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it

uM2z60kDdZo,Walkin' On The Sun,"It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack I know it went out but it's back.
It's just like any fad it retracts before impact
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with it and hip
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique
[Chorus:]
So don't delay act now supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer is shun you might as well be walkin' on the sun
Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin' man what the hell happened
Then some were spellbound some were hellbound
Some they fell down and some got back up and
Fought back 'gainst the melt down
And their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it
[Repeat Chorus]
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked

Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind

From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete

Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

I can make the final block; 
And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle, 
I can make all the stadiums rock. 
I can make tonight forever, 
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn; 
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made, 
And I can make all your demons be gone. 
But I'm never gonna make it without you, 
Do you really want to see me crawl? 
And I'm never gonna make it like you do,

bEdcp22WOps,It's All Coming Back To Me Now,"There were nights when the wind was so cold that my body froze in bed if I just listened to it right outside the window. There were days when the sun was so cruel that all the tears turned to dust and I just knew my eyes were drying up forever.
I finished crying in the instant that you left and I can't remember where or when or how and I banished every memory you and I had ever made.
But when you touch me like this and you hold me like that, I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me. When I touch you like this and I hold you like that, it's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me.
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now. There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light. There were things I'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right. There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than any laws allow
Baby, Baby...
If I kiss you like this and if you whisper like that,
it was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me. If you want me like this and if you need me like that,
it was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me.
It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me.
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now.
But it's all coming back.
There were those empty threats and hollow lies and whenever you tried to hurt me, I'd just hurt you even worse and so much deeper. There were hours that just went on for days when alone at last, we'd count up all the chances that were lost to us forever.
But you were history with the slamming of the door and I made myself so strong again, somehow. And I never wasted any of my time on you since then.
But if I touch you like this and if you kiss me like that, it was so long ago but it's all coming back to me. If you touch me like this and if I kiss you like that, it was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me.
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now. There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light. There were things we'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right. There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than all your laws allow. Baby, baby, baby...
When you touch me like this and when you hold me like that, it was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me. When you see me like this and when I see you like that, then we see what we want to see, all coming back to me. The flesh and the fantasies, all coming back to me.

If you forgive me all this, if I forgive you all that, we forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me.

Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow thru completely
So won't you give me all I ask for
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you
Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, cause you mean so much
To me
Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good
So good
There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true
Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, cause you mean so much
To me
There's a feeling in my heart
That I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall
Don't let it be too late
There's a time when words are good
And they just get in the way
So show me how you feel
Baby I'm for real
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,

ZjoNHm4uiwY,Hotel California,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair 
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air 
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light 
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim 
I had to stop for the night 
There she stood in the doorway; 
I heard the mission bell 
And I was thinking to myself, 
'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell' 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor, 
I thought I heard them say... 
Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place 
Such a lovely face 
Plenty of room at the Hotel California 
Any time of year, you can find it here 
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends 
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends 
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. 
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget 
So I called up the Captain, 
'Please bring me my wine' 
He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine' 
And still those voices are calling from far away, 
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say... 
Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place 
Such a lovely face 
They livin' it up at the Hotel California 
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis 
Mirrors on the ceiling, 
The pink champagne on ice 
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device' 
And in the master's chambers, 
They gathered for the feast 
The stab it with their steely knives, 
But they just can't kill the beast 
Last thing I remember, I was 
Running for the door 
I had to find the passage back 
To the place I was before 
'Relax,'said the night man, 
We are programmed to receive. 
You can checkout any time you like, 
but you can never leave!",Eagles

Til I met this pretty little missle, that shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)

But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster

She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight

So please, don't mess up the trick... hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess have asked someone that's only average
For advice
O.M.G, you listen to that, bitch?
Whoa it's me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin', now I'm crashin'

So I'll bring a better future than I had in the past

I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoaa, whoaaa
I'll admit it, I I was scared to answer loves call
Whoaa, whoaaa

If only for a while
Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
But Please believe me, my heart is in your hands
Cause I'll be missing you
Babe, I love you.
Babe, I love you.

QxrzT8WNxDc,You Haven't Done Nothin',"We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"";You haven't done nothing"";!
It's not too cool to be ridiculed 
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"";You haven't done nothing"";!

Doo doo wop - hey hey hey
Doo doo wop - wow wow wow 
Doo doo wop - co co co 
Doo doo wop - naw naw naw
Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
Doo doo wopWe would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life
But when mislead who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice un hum
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"";You haven't done nothing"";!
Yeah

Doo doo wop

I'm lookin in my rearview
And I can see a clearer view of you
This is the remix...
I see you waitin, I know you hatin...
[Chorus - Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight
[Chamillionaire]
Ch-Chea! Chamillitary mayne... uh, yeah
I got 20 grand in my pocket and, I'm ridin around with my pockets crammed
You the one that got the contraband, and you smokin that like you in Amsterdam
Before I know it, I see them sirens, I'm pullin over - aye, we just ridin!
Don't talk back, won't be no violence, just shut up, and sit in your seat in silence
Now the police is searchin who? They searchin me and then they searchin you
They smell the breeze and you smell like trees
cause you hit the blunt and hit the purple too
Now the lie is irreversable because you just told 'em we were ridin clean
They question you, but they ain't question me yet
I'm thinkin the police ain't find a thing
Standin on the side of the freeway, wishin they would just hurry up
And I can see, you walkin up to me, like he about to put me up in them cuffs
I turned around and I look at you, and you look away like you feelin sick
I'm goin to jail for what I didn't comit, I must admit, that I hate a snitch
[Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty (Cause I'm ridin dirty)
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight (jail tonight)
[Chamillionaire]
Ever since they heard the song ridin dirty
The whole world been listenin I'm glad you heard me
Some cops that representin the badge
been showin me every cop ain't bad or tryin to scurr me
A year after ""White and Nerdy""
On the grind, still tryin, still flyin birdies
That stuff still in ya cup, still drivin swervin
Ridin dirty like the vehicle inside the derby
A little inspired by U.G.K, and the rest inspired by the life I'm livin
Seen that Impala, he was drunk
And that's when I saw the red lights go get em
And it's ironic that during the chase
Seen Murder Chase, and this kid was Christian
Movin target ran across the street
And unfortunately the car didn't miss him
And now the family is soon to know, that they gon have to do another funeral
The angels ain't singin to ya tune no more, don't move too fast, baby move it slow
Cause one day ya here, baby... next thing ya know, next thing ya know
Everything that used to move don't move no more
[Chorus - Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight
[Outro - Chamillionaire]
This is not a movie, it's real life, yeah, yeah...
It's real life, it ain't just a song, it's a message
Nobody ever opens they eyes till somebody gets killed
Rest in peace to Sean Bale

It's my party, and i'll cry if I want to,
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to.
You would cry too, if it happened to you.

I've got no reason to smile.
It's my party, and i'll cry if I want to, ...

XBWDweJBh1I,Ditty,"Yo,  this  is  somethin'  comin'  from  the  nine  deuce  
Another  fat,  fat  track  So  Rhythm  D,  pour  the  orange  juice  
And  let's  relax  while  sippin'  on  yak  Because  it's  like  that  
I'm  causious  of  ho's,  so  Paperboy  wears  prophilatic  
I  wear  a  jimmy  for  the  skins  Cuz  it's  a  long  trip  
Front  row  seats,  aiyo  I  know  she's  on  the  nine  inch  
Just  to  get  a  peice  of  the  green  But  she's  an  undertaker  
Now  you  know  the  Paper  is  an  around  the  world  heart-breaker  
If  you  think  I  fell  for  yo,  had  to  have  a  breakdown  
Playin'  you  fools,  so  now  you  know  why  my  belly's  round  
Takin'  the  rap  back  up  and  scoopin'  up  crowds  just  like  a  steel  shovel 
Not  from  the  ghetto,  but  yo,  takin'  it  to  another  level  
Let  the  beat  ride,  but  hold  on  to  your  women,  G  
Cuz  now  that  I'm  rich  so  many  women  wanna  do  me  
It  make  a  man  say  ""damn""  
I'm  finally  taxin'  more  play  than  homey  Sam  
But  let  me  speak  to  the  weak,  I  mean  the  rookies  
My  time  is  help  up,  extremely  for  cookies  
Just  let  me  clock  this  groove  in  ninety  two  
Hey,  you  don't  bother  me  and  I  sure  'nuff  won't  bother  you  
And  ah,  you  just  watch  a  brother  flowin'  like  Niagra  
Think  before  you  step,  because  these  lyrics  just  might  stag  ya  
Although  I'm  labeled  with  the  black  fade  
It's  gold  d's  on  my  foreign  gold  lex,  cuz  I  got  it  made  
I  broke  the  beat  once  again  because  I  had  to  
And  just  like  Jody  Watley,  baby  girl,  I  can  have  you  
Just  let  me  work  this  track,  and  yo,  any  way  is  ok  
Your  place  or  mine,  all  night  until  the  next  day  
Unh  
Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Now  here  we  go  from  the  top  
Second  verse  of  the  same  song  
With  the  conclusion,  I  should  be  out  before  the  ding-dong.  
It's  just  a  mad  park  a  grip,  G  
It's  like  every  nickel  and  dime  nigga  be  like  
""See,  don't  you  remember  me?""  
A  hustler,  and  it's  on  with  more  hoes  to  play  low  
Keep  'em  chunky  like  Prego,  so  they  can  leggo  with  my  eggo  
I  have  a  tendancy  to  flow,  start  off  with  my  own  groove  
Pick  up  the  mic,  and  all  of  a  sudden,  I  see  high  movin'  
Guess  it's  like  magic,  and  Paperboy  is  the  magician  
If  I  was  a  vaccum  I'd  be  suckin'  up  competition  
Let  it  ride  again,  and  yo,  belive  I  got  my  own  thing  
Straight  Bahama  hoes  so  miss  me  with  the  chick  from  Soul  Train  
And  I'm  a  break  my  note,  just  to  show  up  token  
Tote  on  his  ass  when  I  scoop  him,  cuz  we  bud  smokin'  
A  black  man  tryin'  to  make  it  and  that  ain't  no  fair  
But  just  like  BeBe  and  CeCe,  I'll  take  you  there  
Huh  
Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Now  here  we  go  
Uh,  let's  take  a  trip  to  another  land  
Park  a  grip,  come  back  and  watch  the  hoes  tan  
Jump  in  the  lex-o,  and  roll  out  to  my  cabin  
Believe  me,  my  brother,  more  hoes  than  you  can  imagine  
All  on  the  ding-a-ling,  just  because  the  gold  rings  
But  I'm  like  a  supah  choke,  you  ain't  heard  a  damn  thing  
Make  sure  you  got  the  jim  hats,  strapped  for  protection  
Because  to  me,  my  life  is  more  than  my  erection  
And  give  me  a  hand,`if  you  a  fan,  it  ain't  over  yet  
Cuz  doin'  the  ditty  with  Paperboy  makes  the  ocean  sweat  
Leave  you  kinda  startled  like  the  funk  off  of  fritos  
Make  you  man  jealous,  while  hoes  cheese  like  Doritos  
It  ain't  my  fault,  I  lay  the  piper  with  concern  
And  I  ain't  from  Mount  Vernon,  but  a  brother's  money-earnin'  
And  for  those  disagree,  and  then  jack,  that's  a  pitty  
Just  bob  your  head  for  Paperboy  and  the  ditty  
Yeah  
Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  
Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  
Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you",Paperboy

Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said...

Waited for something to come along

We are strangers by day, lovers by night

If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
Know the word's "";discreet""; when part-time lovers 
But if there's some emergency 
Have a male friend to ask for me 
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover

Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

And it was not you my part-time lover

Of part-time lovers

eZVLHjnitnM,Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
[Chorus:]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line 
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again
[chorus]
Didn't we have the beat of times
When love was young and new 
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you
We'll never lose it again
Cause once you know what love is 
You never let it end

tender together

I was here and she was gone

Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on , on the chance that you'll come back to me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong , oh my darling

Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size

Black boy want you in his island world 
He want to take you from the racket boss 
He want to save you but the cause is lost

And she wrap herself around you like a well worn tire

It's kinda hard to talk right now 
Honey why are you crying is everything okay 
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud 
Well, my girls in the next room 
Sometimes I wish she was you 
I guess we never really moved on 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name 
It sounds so sweet 
Coming from the lips of an angel 
Hearing those words it makes me weak 
And I never wanna say goodbye 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 
It's funny that you're calling me tonight 
And yes I've dreamt of you too 
And does he know you're talking to me 
Will it start a fight 
No I don't think she has a clue 
Well my girls in the next room 
Sometimes I wish she was you 
I guess we never really moved on 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name

Hearing those wordsa it makes me weak

-nIZODoHotI,Got To Give It Up (Part 1),"I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
And my body yearned to be free
So I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me
No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball
Long as you prove it
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
I'm gonna make romance
With your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
Get down and prove it, feel all right

I'll regret that move for as long as I'm living
But now that I've come to see the light
All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word and tell me that I'm forgiven
You and me
We're gonna be better than we were before
I loved you then but now I intend
To open up and love you even more
This time you can be sure
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go
Looking back now it seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all and I took it for granted
But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love that still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances
Wait and see
It's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to giving more
This time you can be sure
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever

Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose
So you just sing the blues all the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in the storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when you're love's on the rocks
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in the storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away

r_10Ds9SthI,To Sir With Love,"Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'
Those awkward years have hurried by, why did they fly, fly away? 
Why is it Sir, children grow up to be people one day?
What takes the place of climbing trees, 
And dirty knees, in the world outside? 
What, what is there that I can buy? 
If you wanted the world, 
I'd surround it with a wall, I'd scrawl 
These words with letters ten feet tall 
To you, with love 
The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?
If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir,
With Love'",Lulu

New York City!
You are now rapping...with 50 Cent
You gotta love it...
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
[Nate Dogg]
Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...
[50 Cent]
If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like 
some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out

Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving

Are you my soulmate 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me Or up and leave me
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone
And always remember girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever
I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought maybe you're not alone
Please give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Please give me one more night, ooh just one more night
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Like a river to the sea
I will always be with you
And if you sail away
I will follow you
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever",Phil Collins

Pullin' petals off a flower, tryna get your way
Keep pullin' 'til it tells what you wanna say
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies
But he'd still be my baby
I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking
You'll be giving him an open invitation
But my baby won't be takin' it, no
[1] - You can pout your cherry lips
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss
You can flirt your pretty eyes
Cuz he ain't got his hands tied
[2] - No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
[Puffy]
I can see clearly now
[Dream]
You're the kind of girl that's always up for do or dare
Only want him because he's there
Always lookin' for a new ride
The grass is greener on the other side
You're the kind of girl who's not used to hearin' no
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go
Doesn't matter how hard you try
You're never gonna get with my guy

Yo, yo, I wake up in the morning for the breakfast in bed (uh huh)

Tradin' the moon and the sun (yeah)
For hard work and fun (that's right)
You know it ain't no rest
And why you stressin' me, huh (why you stressin' me, huh)
I love you like Kung Fu and new ones
Don't worry about Susan, cuz you the one (you the one)
I make that spinach somewhere in Venice (bounce)
I don't mean to ignore you, I put you in the fence (come on)
I ain't got time for hotlines
Probably a hot nine, you think and I find (take it, heh)

FB5rskV0bls,Love Story,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashbacks starts
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""please don't go""
And I said
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""please don't go""
And I said
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""
Oh, ohh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in thy head, I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""

'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess, and I don't mean maybe - please
Chorus:
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, oh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm...
He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice, please

Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now

wHvSAWWmADk,Doo Wop (That Thing),"It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down then you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him
If you did it then, then you probably f*** again
Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hardrock when you're really a gem
Babygirl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas f***ed up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen
Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of their three and four kids men
They facing a court case when the child's support late
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the s***n stop acting like boys and be men
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing",Lauryn Hill

She's blood, flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound
But somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's gonna happen
'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high, high above me
First class and fancy free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother?
(Chorus)
She calls to speak to me
I freeze immediately
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal
'Cause somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's gonna happen

Someone I've needed so long

And somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me",Stevie Wonder

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours,
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon but
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard",Sheryl Crow

Oh when I went away 
For doin' my first crime
And I never thought 
That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down South
Oh I'm with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)
[Repeat Refrain and Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slightin'
And I don't know
How to make it better (make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)
You're way too beautiful girl

Don't you know I need somebody who can do me right 
And keep his pockets tight 
I don't know why I keep taking this mess from you

All I see over here ain't nothin' but a lot of honies lookin' for man 
And niggas with a lot of money, bottles in they hand 
And short shirts, honies tryin' to show that slow (show that)
Lined up tryin' to get through the velvet ropes
'Cause over here when the jam drops everybody bug
Standin' on the couches like this our club
Got the Bacardi and Cristal mixed in too (yeah)
Knowin' in the morning I'm a feel the blues (uh huh)
Now the jam keeps droppin' and the drinks keep comin'
and the girls keep talkin' to me (talkin' to you)
I mean shit straight poppin' everybody jumpin'
Makin' it hard for me to leave (oh)
[Da Brat:]
All you gotta do is call me and I'll come runnin' to where the party at
I keep a fat sack in the backpack
So what's happenin'
In every city I'm rappin' in
If it's a after splash I'm the last cat in
Get in, purrin' tight like virgin
Like snow, flurrin'
The party begins when the slurpin' ends (oh)
You do me I do you
Spend a night with boo-boo
Let's have a private party for two
But it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream
Runnin' to the border for Colombian's green
Studyin' horniculture
My green thumb keeps them water vapors twistin'
I freak until I cum
I keeps it number one

His little Jag and Benz with the Rolls
Not the one with the stems, the one with the rims
The one that seems to make more enemies than friends
I'm slidin' in pass doors, both eyes closed
Both arms rose, both charms froze
With the S-O SO D-E dot F
Buyin' bottles bottles, until it ain't none left

Tell me if you, were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me
Would you trust me
But you feedin' me, All this rap about, 
How it's different 
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked.
Now I'm having, second thoughts about, 
You and me, cuz this is not how I want it or it should be.

You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
You're tellin' me it's different

If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.
You're creepin' on him for me,
But you say just trust me.

And what goes around comes back around
Till you find out it's harder

That you're totally his, but you're here in my room
Don't cha'll talk wit me
All hugged up,

in fact no brotherman here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me,
but it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only,
know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr.Wendal, that's his name,
no one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,
until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges,
still most of y'all come out confused
[CHORUS:] Go ahead, Mr.Wendal (2x)
Mr.Wendal has freedom,
a free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
for Mr.Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
and an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him,
but I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no ?
Who are we to judge ?
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
and killed over a racist grudge
Mr.Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
but we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far,
and we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr.Wendal, a man, a human in flesh,
but not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride,
realize that all in all you stand tall

We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

We lost our starry notions on the way

We'd smile at one another and we'd say
Those were the days my friend

We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la...
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
Those were the days my friend

ozKsQnRHb-c,Angel,"Spend all your time waiting
for that second chance
for a break that would make it okay
there's always one reason
to feel not good enough
and it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
oh beautiful release
memory seeps from my veins
let me be empty
and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
in the arms of an angel
fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room
and the endlessness that you fear
you are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort there
so tired of the straight line
and everywhere you turn
there's vultures and thieves at your back
and the storm keeps on twisting
you keep on building the lie
that you make up for all that you lack
it don't make no difference
escaping one last time
it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees
in the arms of an angel
fly away from here
from this dark cold hotel room
and the endlessness that you fear
you are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort there
you're in the arms of the angel
may you find some comfort here",Sarah McLachlan

you'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
And she'll always give you peace of mind
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Don't let your friends say you have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match
Take it from me, she's a better catch
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Spoken:
Say man!
Hey baby!
I saw your wife the other day!
Yeah?
Yeah, an' she's ug-leeee!
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby!
Yeah, alright!
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife

nkxZjlAMBvQ,Tell It Like It Is,"If you want something to play with 
Go and find yourself a toy 
Baby my time is too expensive 
And I'm not a little boy 
If you are serious 
Don't play with my heart 
It makes me furious 
But if you want me to love you 
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will 
Tell it like it is 
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide 
But I know deep down inside me 
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride 
Life is too short to have sorrow 
You may be here today and gone tomorrow 
You might as well get what you want 
So go on and live, baby go on and live 
Tell it like it is 
I'm nothing to play with 
Go and find yourself a toy 
But I... Tell it like it is

Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit nervouse that the best of all the years have gone by. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.
And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever and if you'll only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever and we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong together. We can take it to the end of the line. Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time. I don't know what to do, I'm always in the dark. We're living in a power keg and giving off sparks.

Turn around bright eyes. Turn around bright eyes.
Turn around, every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be.  Turn around, every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am. Turn around, every now and then I know there's no one in the universe who's as magical and wondrous as you. Turn around, every now and then I know there's nothing any better, there's nothing that I just wouldn't do. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart. Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart.

Don't get lonely now
Dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight
you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
to try and slag me down because I know I'm right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing
was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just
not right
No time to search the world around

Until you've been beside a man

You don't know if he cries at night 
You don't know if he don't 
When nothin comes easy 
Old nightmares are real 
Until you' ve been beside a man 
You don't know how he feels 
Once inside a woman's heart 
A man must keep his head 
Heaven opens up the door 
Where angels fear to tread 
Some men go crazy 
Some men go slow 
Some men go just where they want 
Some men never go 
Oh blame it on midnight 
Ooh shame on the moon 
Everywhere it's all around 
Comfort in a crowd 
Strangers faces all around 
Laughin right out loud 
Hey watch where your goin 
Step light on old toes 
Cause until you've been beside a man 
You don't know who he knows 
Oh blame it on midnight

It's late September and I really should be back at school 
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used 
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more 
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone 
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt 
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age 
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything 
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax 
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more 
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone 
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without 
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand 
But you turned into a lover and 
mother what a lover, you wore me out 
All you did was wreck my bed 
and in the morning kick me in the head 
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore 
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone 
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried 
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school 
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool 
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand

yrHRWgq2-n0,Rhythm Of The Night,"(Jackson Browne)
When you look over your shoulder
And you see the life that you've left behind
When you think it over do you ever wonder?
What it is that holds your life so close to mine
You love the thunder and you love the rain
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain
And before the lightning fades and you surrender
You've got a second to look at the dark side of the man
You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
And I know you wonder how you ever came
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame
Draw the shade and light the fire
For the night that holds you and calls your name
And just like your lover, knows your desire
And the crazy longing that time will never tame
You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
I got your number if it's still the same
You can dream
But you can never go back the way you came",DeBarge

I can't keep running back to you

No more broken heart for me
No more tellin' your lies to me (And another one)

No more givin' you everythin'
There's no more takin' my love from me (what)

Glad to wake up every day without you on my brain

You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian, trips to the Carribean
But tonight, no ends

You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin'

See my days are cold without you

And though my heart can't take no more,
I can't keep running back to you

7S5iANxYIYQ,Sunny Came Home,"by Shawn Colvin   John Leventhal 
Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission
She says days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said 
Sunny came home with a vengeance
She says days go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it
Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own and she's alright
Sunny came home
Sunny came home...",Shawn Colvin

Can we ascend to higher heights 
And when the path gets rough 
We can give into Friday nights breath we peace 
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap 
Our souls to keep 
The passion's deep and filled with heat 
Living this life on the hustle I barely get enough time 
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine 
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world 
A reputation known as the untouchable girl 
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways 
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days 
Now we can play, past ways, or just ain't got time 
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine 
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by 
You and I don't need permission to be unified 
Surely I done seen and heard a million places 
Then I travel around the world, see many faces 
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true 
You can show me that nobody else can do it better than you 
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got 
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots

All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way

Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)

Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)

Picture this, we were both butt naked

From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me
Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on da right prefix 
Whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein is believin so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Wait for your answer: go over there 
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry 
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin to your reasonin
It makes no sense at all

Sine the moment I spetted you
Like walking round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies... and it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied
[Pre-Chorus:]
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Seems like everything I say to you
Comes otu wrong and never comes out right
[Chorus:]
So I'll say 'why don't you and I get togehter and take on the world
and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon
and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never going to let me in
And slowly I begin to realize this is never going to end
Right about the same you walk by
And I say 'Oh here we go again'
When's thisever going to break
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
And it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down

O87shD-FpvU,Superman (It's Not Easy),"I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
I'm just out to find
The better part of me 
I'm more than a bird:I'm more than a plane
More than some pretty face beside a train
It's not easy to be me 
Wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
About a home I'll never see 
It may sound absurd:but don't be naive
Even Heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed:but won't you conceed
Even Heroes have the right to dream
It's not easy to be me 
Up, up and away:away from me
It's all right:You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy:or anything: 
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me

When it's love you give 
I'll be a man of good faith. 
then in love you live. 
I'll make a stand. I won't break.
I'll be the rock you can build on, 
be there when you're old,
to have and to hold. 
When there's love inside 
I swear I'll always be strong.
then there's a reason why. 
I'll prove to you we belong. 
I'll be the wal that protects you 
from the wind and the rain, 
from the hurt and pain. 
Let's make it all for one and all for love. 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for onee it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know 
then just let your feelings show 
and make it all for one and all for love. 
When it's love you make 
I'll be the fire in your night. 
then it's love you take. 
I will defend, I will fight. 
I'll be there when you need me.
When honor's at stake, 
this vow I will make: 
that it's all for one and all for love. 
Let the one be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know 
then just let your feelings show 
and make it all for one and all for love.
Don't lay our love to rest 
'cause we could stand up to you test.
We got everything and more than we had planned, 
more than the rivers that run the land. 
We've got it all in our hands. 
Now it's all for one and all for love.
It's all for love. 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
It's one for all.

ohOtDA3dTAA,Wind Of Change,"Lyrics:Klaus Meine
I folow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change
The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change",Scorpions 
Rpq35wyDi7I,Blinded By The Light,"Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer
With a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder
Feeling kinda older
I tripped a merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing
Sneezing and wheezing
The calliope crashed to the ground
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight
She's gonna make it through the night
Some silicone sister
With her manager mister
Told me I've got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny to
something strong
Play the song with the funky break
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in her curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride
Mama always told me not to look into
the eyes of the sun
But mama that's where the fun is
Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funnybone
That's where they expect it least
And some new mown chaperone
Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sewn moonstone
Was messin' with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance",Manfred Mann's Earth Band 
mHwGqV6YOwo,Blue Bayou,"I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickles saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickles saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Oh that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well I'll never be blue
My dreams come true

It was a time I remember, oh, so well
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na,

There goes Robert E. Lee.""

And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand

I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please, 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
'If you think you're lonely now'
Wait a minute
This is too deep, too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life baby
[Chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please, 'cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together",Mariah Carey 
HuAZjaHh9vE,You Belong With Me,"You're on the phone
With your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about
Something that you said
She doesn't get your humor
Like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music
She doesn't like
She'll never know your story
Like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
When you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see
That i'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you
See you belong with me
You belong with me.
Walking the streets
With you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking
This is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
Thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine
I know you better than that
Hey whatchu doing
With a girl like that
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
When you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see
That i'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you
See you belong with me
Standing by and
Waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know
Baby
You belong with me
You belong with me.
[Instrumental]
Oh, I remember
You driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see
That i'm the one
Who understands
Been here all along
So why can't you see?
You belong with me.
Have you ever thought
Just maybe
You belong with me?",Taylor Swift

The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth 
To gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees
Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord
You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find 
No way on earth 
To gain peace of mind

Get down on your knees and pray

And you'll surely find the way",Elvis Presley

You said that you'd be here by nine 
And said you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why you do this to me
[Chorus 1 (sung by Faith Evans)]
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is hat I have to say: 
All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you play with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me
Now I see that you been doing wrong 
You played me all along. 
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me. 
How could you do it to me

How many seas must a white dove sail 
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannon balls fly 
Before they're forever banned? 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
How many years must a mountain exist 
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist 
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head 
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
How many times must a man look up

How many ears must one man have 
Before he can hear people cry?

That too many people have died?

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do? 
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
My head is saying, "";Fool, forget him.""; 
My heart is saying, "";Don't let go. 
Hold on till the end.""; 
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

Keep my hand in the fire

To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on
And leave you behind

Sorry but I gotta be strong

When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor

So when life get hot in july it's the world against you and I

agC7SoihH-o,The Living Years,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't  get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye",Mike + The Mechanics

But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day...
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing I learned 
Is that I need you desperately...
So here I am 
And can you please tell me... oh
[Chorus:]
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms 
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
I've been around enough to know 
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away...
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know...

Almost comatose
Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in Rapture
Back to back

Spinless movement
And a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in Rapture

DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Francois sez fas, Flashe' no do

And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe

Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door, hall to hall

Man to man, body muscular
Sismic decibel by the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology and a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

Some say love, it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger,
an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
and you its only seed.
It's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking
that never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
who cannot seem to give,
and the soul afraid of dyin'
that never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely
and the road has been to long,
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong,
just remember in the winter
far beneath the bitter snows
lies the seed that with the sun's love
in the spring becomes the rose.",Bette Midler

Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without
I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Has quite the same ooh ooh (ha ha ha!)
Like you do do do do babe

We had to prove them wrong

You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know

Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

I'm still alive

And I'm strong, and there's a chance

Going coming thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one

I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to

Without something there to remaind me 
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in

If you didn't notice boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again

And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to

Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go 
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be 
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you

Nothing compares 2 u

Like a bird without a song 
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling 
Tell me baby where did I go wrong 
I could put my arms around every boy I see 
But they'd only remind me of you 
I went to the doctor n'guess what he told me 
Guess what he told me 
He said girl u better have fun 
No matter what u do 
But he's a fool 
`Cause nothing compares 
Nothing compares 2 u

Nn5IvIwBBec,My Life Would Suck Without You,"[Verse 1:]
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back 
All you said before
Like how much you wanted 
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again
[Chorus:]
Because we belong together now
Forever united here somehow
Yeah you got a piece of me
And honestly
My life would suck without you
[Verse 2:]
Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for trying to pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you
[Chorus:]
Because we belong together now
Forever united here somehow
Yeah you got a piece of me
And honestly
My life would suck without you
[Bridge:]
Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go
Oh Yeah
[Chorus:]
Because we belong together now
Forever united here somehow
Yeah you got a piece of me
And honestly
My life would suck without you",Kelly Clarkson

The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
the feeling of belonging to your dreams.

And I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand
Go fix yourself
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life

6ge53QaDpKQ,Bitch,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one
[Chorus:]
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way
So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing
[Chorus]
Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me
[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way",Meredith Brooks

To know where my lucky love belongs,

Well the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels
You didn't know what rock-n-roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired you're lookin' kinda beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
You didn't know how rock-n-roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home from messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
You didn't know that rock-n-roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
I didn't know you had a rock-n-roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now it's dark and you're gone

It must have been cold there in my shadow,
to never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.
You always walked a step behind.
So I was the one with all the glory,
while you were the one with all the strain.
A beautiful face without a name for so long.
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.
Did you ever know that you're my hero,
and everything I would like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings.
It might have appeared to go unnoticed,
but I've got it all here in my heart.
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.
I would be nothing without you.
Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I wish I could be.
I could fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings.
Did I ever tell you you're my hero
You're everything, everything I wish I could be.
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings,
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.
Oh, the wind beneath my wings.
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings.
Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.

He liked to hang out late 
he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs 
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head 
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead 
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain

We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
Get funky. Yeah Timmy.
Tell it like it is. Check out this DJ.
So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place.
Chorus 1
Smokin.' Not cokin.' Get funky sax.
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch.
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance.
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass...rock this place!
What is he like? What's he like anway?
Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man
You know I mean?
Chorus 2 (twice)
Wind on my face, sound in my ears
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind
As I sink, diving down deep...deeper into your soul.

NJu170h7EhE,Father Figure,"That's all I wanted
Somthing special, something sacred -
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
Maybe this time is forever.....
Say it can be
That's all you wanted
Something special, something sacred -
In your life
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
But something tells me together
We'd be happy
(Baby)
I will be your father figure
(Oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher
(Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind
(It would make me)
I will be your father figure
(Very happy)
I have had enough of crime
(Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you -
Until the end of time
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyed shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
Until the end of time
If you are the desert
I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger -
Hunger for me
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be....
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby, baby
And love can't lie, no....
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always telling me so....
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
I won't let you go, my baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
(So I am gonna love you)
Until the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your preacher
I'll be your daddy
I will be the one who loves you until the end of time",George Michael

I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this auch a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...
on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time...on my
own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...
on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one",Guns N' Roses

Just to pass the time
There's somethin' wrong here
There can be no denying
One of us is changin'
Or maybe we just stopped trying
And it's too late, baby,
Now it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...
It used to be so easy
Livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy
And I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy
And I feel like a fool
And it's too late, baby,
Now it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no...
There'll be good times again
For me and you,
But we just can't stay together
Can't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had
And how I once loved you,
But it's too late, baby,
Now it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...

Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own
Shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much 
I get so emotional, baby 
Every time I think of you 
I get so emotional, baby 
Ain't it shocking what love can do 
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

_FsgQwIszYI,Last Night,"Last night you were so in to in
You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tatsted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
[Chorus:]
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun , the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
[Chorus]
Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love",AZ Yet 
XVr7ATjwmKU,Sexy Eyes,"(Allison Moorer/Doyle Primm)
Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day and learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind",Dr. Hook

U2qLu1CYBf4,Tell Her About It,"Listen boy
Don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away
You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made
She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do
Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means
Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure
Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe
Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone
Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means
Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait--you got to
Tell her about it",Billy Joel

It couldn't be no

Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you

I'm going to marry you
Will you marry me Uncle Ray?
Oh! Clair, Clair
Clair, I've told you before
Don't you dare
Get back into bed
Can't you see that it's late
No you can't have a drink
Oh! all right then but wait just a bit

Catch of my breath what there is left of it.

They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others 
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that clost to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friends is true they'll be there with you 
Through the thick and thin

I wouldn't change not for no money

Vr3v3011LhQ,Still The Same,"Words and Music by Bob Seger 
You always won, everytime you placed a bet 
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet 
Everytime they were sure they had you caught 
You were quicker than they thought 
You'd just turn your back and walk 
You always said, the cards would never do you wrong 
The trick you said was never piay the game too long 
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take 
The only loss you could forsake 
The only bluff you couldn't fake 
And you're still the same 
I caught up with you yesterday 
Moving game to game 
No one standing in your way 
Turning on the charm 
Long enough to get you by 
You're still the same 
You still aim high 
There you stood, everybody watched you play 
I just turned and walked away 
I had nothing left to say 
'Cause you're still the same 
You're still the same 
Moving game to game 
Some thlngs never change",Bob Seger 
bn_1_HJICBA,Fill Me In,"(All right)
(Come on)
(Can you fill me in)
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor
So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone
I'm not being mean
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say hey girl, come on right around
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride
Chucked in where nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down down down to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it coz you felt cold
I'm not being mean
I didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in
(Can you fill me in)
All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you
Baby
(Craig David)
Watching our every move
Think some day they might approve
Baby
Why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in

Whoa, but heaven...no, heaven don't hear me

And blood spilling
That world never came

Fm_-sW4Vktw,More Than A Feeling,"I looked out this morning and the sun was gone 
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky
It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped awa y. She slipped away. 
It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you 
& I'm wishing that you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone, 
Girl you could have stayed 
but you wouldnt give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more then i can stand
And all my tears they keep running down my face
Why did you turn away?
[Bridge]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me? 
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you wanted to be
[Chorus]
So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just aint true
I really need you in my life
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You got me feeling crazy (crazy)
How can you walk away,
Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby
What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is & it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me, your still in love with me
Don't leave me crying.
[Bridge]
Baby why can't we just start over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But your telling me it wont be enough

So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time

If you think I'm fine it just aint true
I really need you in my life
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you

You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
Out on to an open road you ride until the day
You learn to sleep at nigth with the price you pay
Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies
And in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death
Driving on through the night, unable to break away
From the restless pull of the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Now they'd come so far and they'd waited so long
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
Where the dark of night holds back the light of day
And you've gotta stand and fight for the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your hands
Do you remember the story of the promised land
How he crossed the desert sands
And could not enter the chosen land
On the banks of the river he stayed
To face the price you pay
So let the game start, you better run you little wild heart
You can run through all the nights and all the days
But just across the county line, a stranger passing through put up a sign
That counts the man fallen away to the price you pay, and girl before the end of
the day
I'm gonna tear it down and throw it away",Donny Osmond

kguRNaAO8oc,When I'm Gone,"[Introduction]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going""
But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice
""Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""die Shady"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..
[Chorus/Outro]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain

With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated 
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way

Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love you
I know that we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Dr. Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending
And you will never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending

A song comes on the radio
And there U are baby once again

Gets me all choked up

Everything I needed 
I feel in your eyes 
Always tought of keepin- 
Your heart next to mine 
But now that seems so far away 
Don't know how love could leave 
Without a trace 
Where do silent hearts go? 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Candle in the water - Drifting helplessly 
Hiding from the thunder- 
Come and rescue me 
Driven by hunger - 
Of the endless dream 
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold 
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know 
Where do silent hearts go? 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Then one touch overcomes the silence 
Love still survives 
Two hearts needing one another 
Give me wings to fly 
Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
I've got someone to give my heart to 
Feel it getting stronger and stronger 
And stronger 
And I feel inside 
Hearts are made to last 
Till the end of time",Celine Dion

See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me
[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off
[Bridge]
I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...
I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know
[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciated all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

Jmd4OLzhQw0,We Are The Champions,"We Are The Champions
Written by Freddie Mercury
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand
Kicked in my face
But I've come through
And we mean to go on and on and on and on
We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the World
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before
The whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go on and on and on and on
We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the World
We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers

Every whisper 
Of every waking hour I'm 
Choosing my confessions 
Trying to keep an eye on you 
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool 
Oh no I've said too much 
I set it up 
Consider this 
The hint of the century 
Consider this 
The slip that brought me 
To my knees failed 
What if all these fantasies 
Come flailing around

I think I thought I saw you try

out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality
I never though love was meant for me
For Iwas blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the 
difference
Now love is so sincere

Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

You wanna dance
Ha, I'ma make you dance
You wanna move
Ha, I'ma make you move
Dru Hill come on
[Dru Hill]
I got this feeling
I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around
Like I was your fool
Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me bout things going on
But deep in my heart babe
I hope that I'm wrong
[Chorus]
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed)
Sleepin' in bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Takin my place, Oh oh)
I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face
(Written on your face)
Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door
But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me things are still the same
Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name
[Chorus]
What else did you want
What else did you need
Giving you everything plus my heart
I gave you the world (Yes I did)
Cause you were my girl (Oh yes I)
But you still ran out on me
[Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, fly shit, differnt colors whips
I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips
Got too many
[Da Brat]
My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family
[Jermaine Dupri]
Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs
And now I keep it commin' stong till the early morn
[Da Brat]
Lemme interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit
[Jermaine Dupri]
I make em sick cause I'm the williest
[Da Brat]
Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch
[Jermaine Durpi]
Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal
[Da Brat]
Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers
[Jermaine Dupri]
We make believers out of dreamers

8Y7TAZtbqzI,Missing,"I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And pass your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were
Two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind
While you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you
Shout down to me
Where I always used to be
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train
I ask
Why did I come again?
Can I confess
I've been hanging'round
Your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing
Since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on
And I miss you-
Like the deserts miss the rain",Everything But The Girl
